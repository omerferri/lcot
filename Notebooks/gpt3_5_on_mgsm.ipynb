Ella vende el resto en el mercado de agricultores diariamente por $2 por cada huevo de pato fresco. Entonces, primero encontramos cuántos huevos le quedan después de comer y hornear. 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 huevos. Luego, multiplicamos el número de huevos restantes por el precio de venta por huevo. 9 * $2 = $18. Janet gana $18 cada día en el mercado de agricultores. La respuesta es $18.\n",

1. Josha bought the house for $80,000.
2. He spent $50,000 on renovations, which increased the value of the house by 150%.
3. To calculate the increase in value, we multiply the original value by the percentage increase: $80,000 * 150% = $120,000.
4. The total value of the house after renovations is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.
5. To calculate the profit, we subtract the total cost (purchase price + renovation cost) from the total value: $200,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000) = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

Kylar needs to buy 16 glasses.
The first glass costs $5.
The second glass costs 60% of the price of the first glass.
To find the price of the second glass, we need to calculate 60% of $5.
60% of $5 is (60/100) * $5 = $3.
So, the second glass costs $3.
Now, we need to calculate the total cost of all the glasses.
The cost of the first glass is $5.
The cost of the second glass is $3.
For the remaining 14 glasses, we can assume they all cost $3 each.
So, the total cost of the remaining 14 glasses is 14 * $3 = $42.

Itachukua miaka mingapi kabla ya yeye kuanza kupata mapato kutoka kwa mlimau huo?",13,"Step-by-Step Answer: Carlos will spend $90 to plant the lime tree. Each year, the tree will bear 7 limes, which he can sell for $1.5 each. The cost of watering and fertilizing the tree each year is $3. To calculate how many years it will take for Carlos to start making a profit from the lime tree, we need to compare the income from selling limes to the expenses of watering and fertilizing the tree. 

First, let's calculate the annual income from selling limes. Carlos will earn $1.5 x 7 = $10.5 per year from selling limes.

Next, let's calculate the annual expenses of watering and fertilizing the tree. Carlos will spend $3 per year on watering and fertilizing the tree.

To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start making a profit, we need to divide the initial cost of planting the tree ($90) by the annual profit ($10.5 - $3 = $7.5).

$90 / $7.5 = 12

2. Kisha, tunahitaji kuhesabu idadi ya wanafunzi waliosalia baada ya kujisajili katika densi ya kisasa. Hii inaweza kufanyika kwa kuchukua 100% - 20% = 80% ya wanafunzi wote.

3. Sasa tunahitaji kuhesabu idadi ya wanafunzi waliojisajili katika densi ya jazi. Kwa kuwa 25% ya wanafunzi waliosalia walijisajili katika densi hiyo, tunaweza kuhesabu 25% ya 16 wanafunzi.

Iwapo anataka kasi yake ya wastani iwe maili 4 kwa saa, anahitaji kutembea kwa kasi (katika maili kwa saa) gani kwa umbali unaosalia?",6,"Step-by-Step Answer: Marissa walked a total distance of 12 miles. She walked 4 miles in the first hour and 2 miles in the second hour. So, she has already walked 4 + 2 = 6 miles. 

To find out how fast she needs to walk for the remaining distance to have an average speed of 4 miles per hour, we need to subtract the distance she has already walked from the total distance. 

The remaining distance is 12 - 6 = 6 miles. 

To find the time it will take her to walk the remaining distance at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

So, the time it will take her to walk the remaining distance is 6 / 4 = 1.5 hours. 

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of 4 miles per hour for the remaining distance.

2. The discounted price is 25% less than the original price.
3. Let's assume the original price of the book is x dollars.
4. 25% of x is (25/100) * x = 0.25x.
5. The discounted price is x - 0.25x = 0.75x dollars.
6. We know that the discounted price is $19.50.
7. So, 0.75x = $19.50.

He stopped the second time when he had 15 miles left to finish the ride.

According to the prompt, the second pair of high-heeled shoes costs twice as much as the first pair, so it would cost 2x dollars. The total cost of the two pairs of high-heeled shoes is x + 2x = 3x dollars. 

Now, we know that the cost of the boots is 5 dollars less than the cost of the two pairs of high-heeled shoes. So, the cost of the boots would be 3x - 5 dollars. 

Since Gloria chooses the boots when their cost matches her shoe budget, we can set up the equation: 3x - 5 = x. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x = 5. 

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we find that x = 2.5. 

Therefore, the cost of the boots is 3(2.5) - 5 = 7.5 - 5 = 2.5 dollars.

1. The ratio of Darrel's age to Allen's age is 7:11.
2. Let's assume that Darrel's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x.
3. The sum of their ages is 162, so we can write the equation 7x + 11x = 162.
4. Combining like terms, we get 18x = 162.
5. Dividing both sides of the equation by 18, we find that x = 9.
6. Now we can find Allen's current age by substituting x = 9 into the equation. Allen's age is 11x = 11 * 9 = 99.
7. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age. 99 + 10 = 109.

The total number of coins is the sum of gold and silver coins, which is x + (x - 30) = 110. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x - 30 = 110. 

Adding 30 to both sides, we get 2x = 140.

",Question: John hukimbia maili 60 kwa wiki. Huwa anakimbia siku 3 kwa wiki. Huwa anakimbia saa 3 siku ya kwanza na nusu ya kiasi hicho kwa siku nyingine mbili anazokimbia. Huwa anakimbia kwa kasi gani?,10,"Step-by-Step Answer: John runs 60 miles per week. He runs 3 days a week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours, and on the other two days, he runs half of that time. 

On the first day, he runs for 3 hours, which is 3 * 60 = 180 minutes. 
On the other two days, he runs for half of that time, which is 180 / 2 = 90 minutes each day. 

So, in total, he runs for 180 + 90 + 90 = 360 minutes per week. 

To find his speed, we need to convert minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 360 minutes is 360 / 60 = 6 hours. 

Therefore, John runs at a speed of 6 miles per hour. 

The answer is 6 miles per hour.",False,189,188,False

Dana's jumping speed is half of her running speed, which means her running speed is twice her jumping speed. 
If she can jump 3 miles per hour, then her running speed is 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour. 
If she uses one-third of an hour to run and two-thirds of an hour to walk, then she spends 1/3 * 6 = 2 miles running and 2/3 * 6 = 4 miles walking.

Akishikilia johari, ni umbali gani zaidi usioweza kufikiwa na miale ya zimwi ambao Polly angesimama na bado kuweza kumgonga zimwi huyo kwa mkuki wa dhahabu?",200,"Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Polly can throw the golden spear up to a distance of 400 feet, which is within the range of the monster's beam.
2. When Polly is not holding the gem, she can throw the spear three times the distance she can throw it when she is holding the gem. So, she can throw the spear up to 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.
3. To find the distance at which Polly can stand and still hit the monster with the golden spear, we need to subtract the maximum throwing distance (1200 feet) from the monster's anger range (1000 feet).
4. Therefore, the distance at which Polly can stand and still hit the monster with the golden spear is 1000 - 1200 = -200 feet.
5. However, a negative distance does not make sense in this context, so we can conclude that Polly cannot stand outside the monster's anger range and still hit it with the golden spear.

1. John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties. Let's say he bought x blue ties.
2. The price of a red tie is 50% more than the price of a blue tie. So the price of a red tie is 1.5 times the price of a blue tie.
3. John spent $200 to buy blue ties, which are sold at $40 each. So he bought 200/40 = 5 blue ties.
4. Since he bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.
5. The total cost of the red ties is 10 * 1.5 * 40 = $600.
6. Therefore, John spent $600 to buy the ties.

Lloyd's chickens lay 252 eggs per day. To calculate the number of eggs per week, we multiply 252 by 7 (the number of days in a week). So, Lloyd's chickens lay 252 * 7 = 1764 eggs per week.
Since Lloyd sells the eggs at $2 per dozen, we need to calculate the number of dozens in 1764 eggs. There are 12 eggs in a dozen, so we divide 1764 by 12. This gives us 147 dozens of eggs.
To calculate the total amount of money Lloyd earns from selling the eggs, we multiply the number of dozens (147) by the price per dozen ($2). So, Lloyd earns 147 * $2 = $294 per week from selling eggs.

Next, we are told that the number of emeralds was twice the number of rubies. Therefore, the number of emeralds is 2 * 140 = 280.

To find the total number of gems in the treasure, we add up the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds: 175 + 140 + 280 = 595.

",Question: Vincent anaweza kununua maua katika vifurushi vya 3 kwa $2.50 au katika vifurushi 2 vya $1. Huwa anaokoa pesa ngapi kwa kununua maua 18 kwa bei bora?,6,"Step-by-Step Answer: 

Vincent can buy flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 or in packages of 2 for $1. 

To find out how much Vincent would save by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in each package size. 

If Vincent buys flowers in packages of 3, he would need to buy 18/3 = 6 packages. 
The cost of buying 6 packages of 3 flowers each would be 6 * $2.50 = $15. 

If Vincent buys flowers in packages of 2, he would need to buy 18/2 = 9 packages. 
The cost of buying 9 packages of 2 flowers each would be 9 * $1 = $9. 

Therefore, Vincent would save $15 - $9 = $6 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

The first time the bell rang, it rang 4 times.
The second time the bell rang, it rang 3 more times than the first time it rang. So, it rang 4 + 3 = 7 times.
The third time the bell rang, it rang half of the number of times it rang the second time. So, it rang 7 / 2 = 3.5 times.
Since we can't have half a ring, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. So, the bell rang 3 times.

1. Sylvie has been working for the company for 5 years, so she is eligible for the annual salary increase.
2. Her initial monthly salary is $600.
3. The annual salary increase is 10% of the previous year's salary.
4. To calculate the salary after 3 more years of service, we need to calculate the salary increase for each year and add it to the previous year's salary.
5. After the first year, the salary increase is 10% of $600, which is $60. So her salary for the second year is $600 + $60 = $660.
6. After the second year, the salary increase is 10% of $660, which is $66. So her salary for the third year is $660 + $66 = $726.
7. After the third year, the salary increase is 10% of $726, which is $72.60. So her salary for the fourth year is $726 + $72.60 = $798.60.

","Question: Kwa wanafunzi 200 wa darasa la 5, 2/5 ni wavulana na 2/3 ya wasichana wapo katika skauti ya wasichana. Ni wasichana wangapi hawako kwenye skauti ya wasichana?",40,"Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Kuna wanafunzi 200 katika darasa la 5.
2. 2/5 ya wanafunzi hao ni wavulana. Kwa hiyo, idadi ya wavulana ni (2/5) * 200 = 80.
3. Hii ina maana kuwa idadi ya wasichana ni 200 - 80 = 120.
4. 2/3 ya wasichana wako katika skauti ya wasichana. Kwa hiyo, idadi ya wasichana katika skauti ni (2/3) * 120 = 80.
5. Ili kujua idadi ya wasichana ambao hawako katika skauti ya wasichana, tunatolea idadi ya wasichana katika skauti kutoka idadi ya wasichana jumla. Hivyo, idadi ya wasichana ambao hawako katika skauti ya wasichana ni 120 - 80 = 40.

Idadi ya juu zaidi ya picha ambazo simu ya Brittany inaweza kubeba ni mara 50 zaidi ya idadi ya ndege katika picha ya Jamal ya bata katika mahali pa kufuga wanyama pori. Ikiwa simu ya Jamal inaweza kubeba picha 1800, bata wangapi wanaweza kuonekana katika picha ya Jama ya bata katika mahali pa kufuga wanyama pori?",6,"Step-by-Step Answer: 
Let's assume the number of pictures that Brittany's phone can hold is x.
According to the given information, Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more pictures than Brittany's phone. So, the number of pictures Jamal's phone can hold is 6x.
It is also given that the maximum number of pictures Brittany's phone can hold is 50 more than the number of ducks in Jamal's picture of ducks in the wildlife sanctuary.
So, x = number of ducks in Jamal's picture of ducks in the wildlife sanctuary.
Given that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 pictures, we can set up the equation 6x = 1800.
Solving this equation, we find x = 300.
Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's picture of ducks in the wildlife sanctuary is 300.
The answer is 300.",False,177,181,False

Akiziuza zote, alitengeneza faida ya pesa ngapi?",90,"Step-by-Step Answer: Sasha had 10 pieces of 2 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $10 each, and 5 pieces of 4 x 4 x 10 boards that cost $16 each. The total cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 10 * $10 = $100. The total cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 5 * $16 = $80. So the total cost of all the boards is $100 + $80 = $180. 

Since the price of logs has increased by 50%, Sasha can sell the boards for 1.5 times their original cost. The selling price of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is 1.5 * $10 = $15 each. The selling price of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is 1.5 * $16 = $24 each. 

Sasha has 10 pieces of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards, so she can sell them for a total of 10 * $15 = $150. She also has 5 pieces of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards, so she can sell them for a total of 5 * $24 = $120. 

Therefore, Sasha can make a total profit of $150 + $120 = $270 by selling all the boards.

3. According to the given information, the total number of small spoons of sugar and cups of water is 120.
4. So, we can write the equation as 7x + 13x = 120.
5. Combining like terms, we get 20x = 120.
6. Dividing both sides of the equation by 20, we get x = 6.
7. Now, we can substitute the value of x back into the equation to find the number of small spoons of sugar.

5. To find out Adrien's salary four years later, we need to calculate the 40% increase: $40000 * 40% = $16000.
6. Adrien's salary four years later is $40000 + $16000 = $56000.

Let's assume the number of worker bees is W, the number of baby bees is B, and the number of queen bees is Q.

According to the given information:
1. The number of worker bees is twice the number of baby bees: W = 2B
2. The number of baby bees is three times the number of queen bees: B = 3Q

We need to find the number of worker bees (W).

Substituting the value of B from equation 2 into equation 1:
W = 2(3Q)
W = 6Q

We also know that the total number of bees in the hive is 700:
W + B + Q = 700

Substituting the value of W from equation 3 into equation 4:
6Q + 3Q + Q = 700
10Q = 700
Q = 70

Now, we can find the number of worker bees (W) using equation 3:
W = 6Q
W = 6(70)
W = 420

Therefore, there are 420 worker bees in the hive.

John buys milk for $2, eggs for $3, light bulbs for $3, cups for $3, and cockroach traps for $4. The total cost before tax is $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15.

To find out who will arrive home faster, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to travel the distance to their home.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Steve to ride his bike home. We know that he lives 3 miles away from school and can ride his bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute. To convert miles to feet, we multiply 3 by 5280 (the number of feet in a mile). So, Steve's distance in feet is 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet. To find the time it takes for Steve to ride his bike, we divide the distance by his speed: 15840 feet / 440 feet per minute = 36 minutes.

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Tim to slide home on his skateboard. We know that he lives 2 miles away from school and can slide at a speed of 264 feet per minute. To convert miles to feet, we multiply 2 by 5280 (the number of feet in a mile). So, Tim's distance in feet is 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet. To find the time it takes for Tim to slide, we divide the distance by his speed: 10560 feet / 264 feet per minute = 40 minutes.

Now, we compare the times it takes for Steve and Tim to reach their homes. Steve takes 36 minutes and Tim takes 40 minutes. The difference in time is 40 - 36 = 4 minutes.

Therefore, the winner will have to wait for 4 minutes before the loser arrives home. The answer is 4.",True,344,341,False

When his friend landed, he ate half of the chips that Dave had eaten. That means his friend ate 14 / 2 = 7 chips. So, there were originally 14 + 7 = 21 chips in the package. Then, three pigeons chased him away from the food, and each pigeon ate 3 chips. That means the pigeons ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 chips. After that, a raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining chips. That means the raccoon ate 2/3 * (21 - 9) = 2/3 * 12 = 8 chips. So, there were 21 - 9 - 8 = 4 chips left. Finally, ants carried away the last chip, leaving 5 behind.

Kila skonzi ina urefu wa inchi 4, kila kroisanti ina urefu wa inchi 6, na kila bageti ina urefu wa futi mbili. 

Kwanza, tunahitaji kubadili vipimo vya urefu kutoka inchi hadi futi. Kuna inchi 12 katika futi moja, hivyo urefu wa skonzi ni 4/12 = 1/3 ya futi, urefu wa kroisanti ni 6/12 = 1/2 ya futi, na urefu wa bageti ni 2 futi.

Kisha tunahitaji kuzidisha urefu wa kila bidhaa na idadi yake. Kwa hiyo, urefu wa skonzi ni (1/3) * 300 = 100 futi, urefu wa kroisanti ni (1/2) * 120 = 60 futi, na urefu wa bageti ni 2 * 60 = 120 futi.

1. The original price of the marble bag is $20.
2. Every two months, the price increases by 20% of the original price.
3. To find the price after 36 months, we need to calculate the price increase for each two-month period and add it to the original price.
4. The price increases by 20% every two months, so after 36 months, there are 36/2 = 18 two-month periods.
5. For each two-month period, the price increases by 20% of the original price, which is 20 * 0.2 = $4.
6. Therefore, the total price increase over 18 two-month periods is 18 * $4 = $72.
7. Adding the price increase to the original price, the final price after 36 months is $20 + $72 = $92.

The cost of one toy soldier is equal to the cost of 3 war toys, and the cost of one red car is $4. 
Let's assume the cost of one war toy is x dollars. 
So, the cost of one toy soldier is 3x dollars. 
And the cost of one red car is $4. 
Therefore, the total cost of all the toys can be calculated as follows: 
5 red cars * $4 + 3 war toys * x dollars + 1 toy soldier * 3x dollars. 
Simplifying the equation, we get: 
20 + 3x + 3x = 20 + 6x. 
Since the cost of one war toy is $5, we can substitute x with 5 in the equation: 
20 + 6(5) = 20 + 30 = 50. 
So, the total cost of all the toys is $50.

Iwapo Jessica anataka kulipa 50% zaidi ya kiwango cha chini zaidi, huwa analipa pesa ngapi kwa mwaka?",18000,"Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Jessica has three types of debts: student loans, credit card debt, and rent payments.
2. The minimum payment for her student loans is $300 per month.
3. The minimum payment for her credit card debt is $200 per month.
4. The minimum payment for her rent is $500 per month.
5. Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment for each debt.
6. To calculate the 50% increase, we multiply each minimum payment by 1.5.
   - 300 * 1.5 = $450 for student loans
   - 200 * 1.5 = $300 for credit card debt
   - 500 * 1.5 = $750 for rent
7. Now we calculate the total amount Jessica pays each month by adding up the increased payments:
   - $450 + $300 + $750 = $1500 per month

To calculate the total time, we need to multiply the time it takes to peel each potato by the number of potatoes and add the time it takes to cut each potato. 

Peeling time: 1.5 minutes x 60 potatoes = 90 minutes

1. Kwa kila galoni, wanatumia $3 ya limau na $2 ya sukari. Hii inamaanisha kwa kila glesi, wanatumia $3/20 ya limau na $2/20 ya sukari.
2. Wanauza kila glesi kwa $0.50. Kwa hiyo, kwa kila glesi, wanapata faida ya $0.50 - ($3/20 + $2/20).

",Question: Lloyd hupata $10 kwa saa anapofunza mtu Hisabati. Wiki ya kwanza alifunza kwa saa 5 na wiki ya pili akafunza kwa saa 8. Alipata pesa ngapi kwa wiki mbili za kwanza?,130,"Step-by-Step Answer: 
Lloyd earns $10 per hour when he teaches someone Mathematics. In the first week, he taught for 5 hours, and in the second week, he taught for 8 hours. 

To find out how much money he earned in the first week, we multiply the number of hours he taught (5) by his hourly rate ($10): 5 * $10 = $50.

To find out how much money he earned in the second week, we multiply the number of hours he taught (8) by his hourly rate ($10): 8 * $10 = $80.

To find out how much money he earned in the first two weeks, we add the amounts earned in each week: $50 + $80 = $130.

Therefore, Lloyd earned $130 in the first two weeks. The answer is $130.",True,176,175,False

Ili kudumisha biashara ya Sandra, ni lazima Fred awasilishe waridi mwekundu ngapi kabla ya saa 11 jioni?",160,"Step-by-Step Answer: Sandra ordered red roses four times more than white roses. If we let the number of white roses be x, then the number of red roses is 4x. Sandra also ordered 200 pink lilies, which is five times more than the number of white roses. So, the number of white roses is x, the number of red roses is 4x, and the number of pink lilies is 5x. 

To maintain Sandra's business, Fred must deliver the red roses before 11 p.m. If the red roses are not delivered, Sandra will change suppliers. 

The total number of roses is the sum of the white roses and the red roses, which is x + 4x = 5x. 

Since Sandra ordered 200 pink lilies, which is five times more than the number of white roses, we can set up the equation 5x = 200. Solving for x, we find that x = 40. 

Therefore, the number of red roses that Fred must deliver before 11 p.m. is 4x = 4 * 40 = 160.

1. Jan's age is given as 30 years.
2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. So, half of Jan's age two years ago was 30/2 = 15 years.
3. Two years ago, Mark's age was 15 + 5 = 20 years.
4. Since Jean is 2 years older than Mark, Jean's age two years ago was 20 + 2 = 22 years.

2. The second team has runners who start with a time of 60 seconds for the first leg and each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner.
3. To find out which team is faster, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the race.

1. The probability of rolling a specific number on a six-sided die is 1/6.
2. To find the probability of rolling a specific number three times in a row, we multiply the probabilities together: (1/6) * (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/216.
3. The probability of rolling any number other than the specific number is 5/6.
4. To find the probability of rolling any number other than the specific number twice in a row, we multiply the probabilities together: (5/6) * (5/6) = 25/36.
5. To find the probability of rolling any number other than the specific number twice in a row and then rolling the specific number three times in a row, we multiply the probabilities together: (25/36) * (1/216) = 25/7776.
6. To find the probability of rolling a number greater than the specific number by 3 or more, we add up the probabilities of rolling the specific number three times in a row and rolling any number other than the specific number twice in a row and then rolling the specific number three times in a row: 1/216 + 25/7776 = 217/7776.

1. Brinley has already completed 5 exercises and has received scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86.

Let's first calculate the total cost of the plates. We are given that half a dozen plates cost $6000 each, so a full dozen of plates would cost 2 * $6000 = $12000.
Now, we are given that twenty dozen cups cost $1200. Since a dozen is equal to 12, twenty dozen cups would be equal to 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
To find the price of each cup, we divide the total cost of the cups by the number of cups: $1200 / 240 = $5.

Ikiwa Sara tayari alikuwa nakiba ya $10 kabla ya kuanza kuwaangalia watoto wa jirani, ni mara ngapi atahitaji kufyeka nyasi kabla ya kuweza kumudu bei ya jaketi na viatu?",10,"Step-by-Step Answer: Sara wants to buy a new jacket for $30 and 2 pairs of shoes for $20 each. She earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's children, and her parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn. Sara already had a savings of $10 before she started babysitting. 

To calculate how much money Sara needs to afford the jacket and shoes, we add the cost of the jacket ($30) to the cost of the shoes (2 pairs * $20/pair = $40). So, the total cost is $30 + $40 = $70.

Next, we calculate how much money Sara earns from babysitting. She babysits 4 times, so she earns 4 * $5 = $20.

Now, we calculate how much money Sara earns from mowing the lawn. Since she needs to earn $70 and she already has $20 from babysitting, she still needs to earn $70 - $20 = $50.

Sara earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, so she needs to mow the lawn $50 / $4 = 12.5 times. Since she can't mow the lawn a fraction of a time, she will need to mow the lawn 13 times.

Therefore, Sara will need to mow the lawn 13 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes. The answer is 13.",False,293,285,False

Ikiwa ana kuku weupe wawili zaidi ya wekundu, ana kuku wekundu wangapi?",4,"Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume the number of red chickens is x. Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens would be x + 2.

The red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs produced by red chickens would be 3x.
The white chickens produce 5 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs produced by white chickens would be 5(x + 2).

Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs collected would be 3x + 5(x + 2) = 42.

Simplifying the equation, we get 3x + 5x + 10 = 42.
Combining like terms, we get 8x + 10 = 42.
Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 8x = 32.
Dividing both sides by 8, we get x = 4.

Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

Ikiwa atakuwa akilipa $165 kila mwezi kwa miezi 12, salio la Janeth linalosalia kufikia wakati huo litakuwa ngapi?",220,"Step-by-Step Answer: Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to repay it with an additional 10% of that amount. 10% of $2000 is $2000 * 10/100 = $200. So, in total, Janeth will repay $2000 + $200 = $2200. 

Janeth will be paying $165 per month for 12 months. So, the total amount she will pay over 12 months is $165 * 12 = $1980. 

To find the remaining balance, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she needs to repay: $2200 - $1980 = $220. 

Therefore, the remaining balance for Janeth at that time will be $220. 

The answer is $220.",True,164,163,False

To find the percentage of the chance of picking a water card, we need to divide the number of water cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100. 

The total number of cards is 30 + 34 + 32 = 96. 

So, the percentage chance of picking a water card is (32/96) * 100 = 33.33%. 

The answer is 33.33%.",False,146,145,False

The base price of the burrito is $6.50.
He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, an avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each.
So the total cost of the burrito without the upgrade is $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + ($0.25 * 2) = $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00.
He decides to upgrade his meal by adding chips and a drink for an additional $3.00.
The total cost of the burrito with the upgrade is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.

Jean alimlipa pesa ngapi?,27000,"Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Jean needs the makeup artist for 6 hours per day, and he needs it done 4 times a week. So, in total, he needs the makeup artist for 6 * 4 = 24 hours per week.
2. The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so for 24 hours, the total cost would be 24 * $250 = $6000 per week.
3. The film takes 5 weeks to complete, so the total cost for the makeup artist would be $6000 * 5 = $30,000.
4. After the film is completed, the makeup artist gives Jean a 10% discount. So, the discount amount would be 10% of $30,000, which is 0.10 * $30,000 = $3000.
5. Jean would pay the makeup artist the original cost minus the discount, which is $30,000 - $3000 = $27,000.

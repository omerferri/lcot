",Question: 珍妮特的鸭子每天下 16 颗蛋。她每天早上早餐时吃 3 颗，每天用 4 颗为自己的朋友做松饼。剩下的鸭蛋她每天拿去农贸市场卖，每颗新鲜鸭蛋卖 2 美元。她每天在农贸市场赚多少钱？,18,"Step-by-Step Answer: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs every day. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast every day and uses 4 eggs to make pancakes for her friends. The remaining eggs are sold at the farmers market for $2 each. To calculate how much money she earns at the farmers market, we need to find out how many eggs are left after breakfast and making pancakes. 

16 eggs - 3 eggs (for breakfast) - 4 eggs (for pancakes) = 9 eggs

So, Janet sells 9 eggs at the farmers market every day. 

To calculate how much money she earns, we multiply the number of eggs sold by the price per egg:

9 eggs * $2/egg = $18

Therefore, Janet earns $18 at the farmers market every day. The answer is $18.",True

Josh bought a house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 on renovations. This means he invested a total of $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.
The value of the house increased by 150%, which means it increased by 150/100 * $130,000 = $195,000.

The tree produces 7 lemons each year, and each lemon can be sold for 1.5 dollars. Carlos also needs to spend 3 dollars each year on watering and fertilizing the tree. 

To calculate how many years it will take for Carlos to start making money from the lemon tree, we need to compare the income from selling lemons with the expenses for watering and fertilizing. 

Each year, Carlos earns 7 lemons * 1.5 dollars/lemon = 10.5 dollars from selling lemons. 
Each year, Carlos spends 3 dollars on watering and fertilizing the tree. 

So, Carlos will start making money when his income from selling lemons is greater than his expenses for watering and fertilizing. 

Let's calculate how many years it will take: 
10.5 dollars - 3 dollars = 7.5 dollars 

It will take Carlos 90 dollars / 7.5 dollars/year = 12 years to start making money from the lemon tree.

Let's assume Melanie initially had x vacuum cleaners.
She sold one-third of them in the green house, which means she sold x/3 vacuum cleaners.
In the red house, she sold 2 more than the initial number, so she sold x/3 + 2 vacuum cleaners.
In the orange house, she sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners, which is (x - (x/3 + 2))/2 vacuum cleaners.
So, the total number of vacuum cleaners sold is x/3 + x/3 + 2 + (x - (x/3 + 2))/2.
The remaining number of vacuum cleaners is x - (x/3 + x/3 + 2 + (x - (x/3 + 2))/2).
According to the question, the remaining number of vacuum cleaners is 5.
So, we have the equation x - (x/3 + x/3 + 2 + (x - (x/3 + 2))/2) = 5.
Simplifying the equation, we get x - 2x/3 - 2 - (x - (x/3 + 2))/2 = 5.

首先，20% 的学生报名学习现代舞，这意味着有 20% * 20 = 4 个学生报名学习现代舞。
剩下的学生中，有 25% 报名学习爵士舞，这意味着有 25% * 16 = 4 个学生报名学习爵士舞。
剩下的学生都报名学习嘻哈舞，所以报名学习嘻哈舞的同学一共有 20 - 4 - 4 = 12 个。

So the increase in value would be 5,000 * 2.5% = $125. The new value of the jewelry would be 5,000 + 125 = $5,125.

The value of the electronic products is $8,000 and it is expected to increase by 1.2%. So the increase in value would be 8,000 * 1.2% = $96. The new value of the electronic products would be 8,000 + 96 = $8,096.

To calculate the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the new value for each item. The profit from the jewelry would be 5,125 - 5,000 = $125. The profit from the electronic products would be 8,096 - 8,000 = $96.

To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings as a teacher and as a cheerleading coach separately, and then add them together.

First, let's calculate her earnings as a teacher:
Jill earns $20 per hour as a teacher and works 35 hours per week. So her weekly earnings as a teacher are 20 * 35 = $700.
Since there are 50 weeks in a year, her annual earnings as a teacher are 700 * 50 = $35,000.

Next, let's calculate her earnings as a cheerleading coach:
Jill earns $30 per hour as a cheerleading coach and works 15 hours per week. So her weekly earnings as a coach are 30 * 15 = $450.
Her annual earnings as a cheerleading coach are 450 * 50 = $22,500.

Finally, let's add her earnings as a teacher and as a cheerleading coach together:
Jill's total annual salary is 35,000 + 22,500 = $57,500.

",Question: 格雷琴有 110 个硬币。金币比银币多 30 个。格雷琴有多少个金币？,70,"Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume the number of silver coins is x. Since the number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins, we can say that the number of gold coins is x + 30. 

According to the given information, the total number of coins is 110. So we can write the equation: x + (x + 30) = 110.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 2x + 30 = 110.

Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get: 2x = 80.

Dividing both sides by 2, we get: x = 40.

Therefore, the number of gold coins is x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70.

The answer is 70.",True

Let's start with Raymond's jewelry quantity, which is given as 40.
Alan's jewelry quantity is 5 more than half of Raymond's jewelry quantity, so Alan has (40/2) + 5 = 25 + 5 = 30 pieces of jewelry.
Sivorn's jewelry quantity is 2 less than Alan's jewelry quantity, so Sivorn has 30 - 2 = 28 pieces of jewelry.

So, the total amount of money he earned from selling Lego was 13 * 15 = $195. He used this money to buy 8 video games, and each game cost $20. So, the total cost of the video games was 8 * 20 = $160. After buying the video games, he had $5 left. Therefore, the remaining amount of money he had after buying the video games was 195 - 160 + 5 = $40. Since each set of Lego was sold for $15, the number of sets of Lego he had left can be calculated by dividing the remaining amount of money by the price of each set, which is 40 / 15 = 2.67. Since we cannot have a fraction of a set, we can conclude that John had 2 sets of Lego left. The answer is 2.",True

",Question: 约翰每周跑 60 英里。他每周跑 3 天，第一天跑 3 小时，后面两天各跑第一天一半的时间。他的跑步速度是多少？,10,"Step-by-Step Answer: 
John runs 60 miles per week. He runs for 3 days each week. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours. On the next two days, he runs for half the time of the first day, which is 3/2 = 1.5 hours each day. 

To find his running speed, we need to divide the total distance he runs by the total time he spends running. 

On the first day, he runs for 3 hours, so he covers a distance of 60 miles / 3 hours = 20 miles per hour. 
On the next two days, he runs for 1.5 hours each day, so he covers a distance of 60 miles / (1.5 hours * 2 days) = 20 miles per hour.

",Question: 约翰买的红色领带数量是蓝色领带数量的两倍。红色领带的价格比蓝色领带的价格高 50%。他花了 200 美元购买每条 40 美元的蓝色领带。他花了多少钱买领带？,800,"Step-by-Step Answer: 
Let's assume the number of blue ties John bought is x.
According to the given information, the number of red ties John bought is 2x.
The price of each blue tie is $40, so the total cost of blue ties is 40x.
The price of each red tie is 50% higher than the price of blue ties, which means the price of each red tie is $40 + ($40 * 50%) = $40 + $20 = $60.
The total cost of red ties is 60 * 2x = 120x.
Therefore, the total cost of all the ties John bought is 40x + 120x = 160x.
Since the total cost is $200, we can set up the equation 160x = 200.
Solving for x, we get x = 200 / 160 = 1.25.
So, John bought 1.25 blue ties.
To find the total cost, we substitute the value of x into the equation: 160 * 1.25 = 200.
Therefore, John spent $200 to buy the ties.

First, we need to find out how much money Peter spends each time he goes to the movies. He spends $7 on a ticket and $7 on popcorn, so he spends a total of $7 + $7 = $14 each time.

$42 ÷ $14 = 3

Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.

The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3,755 pounds. To find out how many boxes the truck can carry without exceeding the weight limit, we need to subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the weight limit. 

Weight limit - (Weight of driver + Weight of empty truck) = Maximum weight the truck can carry

5,000 - 3,755 = 1,245 pounds

Let's assume the initial amount of money that Bailey received is x dollars.
Bailey receives 5 dollars every week for 8 weeks, so she receives a total of 5 * 8 = 40 dollars.
After 8 weeks, Bailey has received a total of x + 40 dollars.
According to the given information, Bailey has received a total of 100 dollars.
Therefore, we can write the equation x + 40 = 100.
To find the initial amount of money Bailey received, we need to solve for x.
Subtracting 40 from both sides of the equation, we get x = 100 - 40 = 60.
So, the initial amount of money Bailey received is 60 dollars.

Vincent can buy a bundle of 3 flowers for $2.50 or a bundle of 2 flowers for $1. 
To find out how much he can save by buying 18 flowers at a better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at both prices. 
If he buys 18 bundles of 3 flowers, he would spend 18 * $2.50 = $45.

There are 20 adult dinosaurs and 5 young dinosaurs. Each adult dinosaur eats 10 pounds of potato salad. Each young dinosaur eats half of that amount, which is 10/2 = 5 pounds of potato salad. 
To calculate the total amount of potato salad needed, we need to add the amount for the adult dinosaurs and the amount for the young dinosaurs. 
For the adult dinosaurs: 20 dinosaurs * 10 pounds/dinosaur = 200 pounds of potato salad.

Let's assume the number of cats is x.
Since the ratio of cats to dogs is 2:1, the number of dogs is 2x.
The total number of cats and dogs is x + 2x = 3x.
According to the given information, the number of rabbits is 12 less than the total number of cats and dogs, which is 3x - 12.
Given that the number of dogs is 60, we can set up the equation 2x = 60 and solve for x.
Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get x = 30.
Substituting x = 30 into the equation 3x - 12, we get 3(30) - 12 = 90 - 12 = 78.
Therefore, the total number of pets in the community is 78.

On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1 episode of his favorite show each night, which is a total of 2 episodes. Each episode is 1 hour long, so he watched 2 * 1 = 2 hours of TV.

On Thursday, he watched 1 episode that is 1 hour long and 1 episode that is 30 minutes long. So, he watched 1 * 1 hour + 1 * 30 minutes = 1 hour + 0.5 hour = 1.5 hours of TV.

Let's assume that Henry made x cookies last year.
Henry wanted to make twice as many cookies as last year, so he made 2x cookies.
But he ended up making 15 more cookies than he intended, so the total number of cookies he made is 2x + 15.
After cooling the cookies, he dropped 5 cookies, so he has 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 cookies left.
We know that he has a total of 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation 2x + 10 = 110.
Solving this equation, we subtract 10 from both sides to get 2x = 100.
Dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 50.
Therefore, Henry made 50 cookies last year.

",Question: 朱丽叶在湖上时，她的船漏水了。她朝着岸边每划 10 英尺，船就进水 2 升。她用 16 秒划了20 英尺。到达岸边需要 64 秒。当朱丽叶到达岸边时，船的进水量是多少？,16,"Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. We know that for every 10 feet Juliet rows towards the shore, the boat takes in 2 liters of water.
2. Juliet rowed 20 feet in 16 seconds, so we can calculate how many times she rowed 10 feet by dividing 20 by 10, which equals 2.
3. Since Juliet rowed 10 feet twice, the boat took in water twice, so the total water intake is 2 liters x 2 = 4 liters.
4. When Juliet reaches the shore, it takes her 64 seconds, which means she rowed 10 feet 6 times (64 seconds divided by 16 seconds).
5. Since the boat takes in water every time Juliet rows 10 feet, the total water intake when she reaches the shore is 4 liters x 6 = 24 liters.
The answer is 24 liters.",False

Let's assume the number of photos that Brittany's phone can hold is x.
According to the given information, Jamal's phone can hold 6 times the number of photos that Brittany's phone can hold. So, Jamal's phone can hold 6x photos.
Also, the maximum number of photos that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of ducks in the photos Jamal took at the zoo. So, x = 50 * number of ducks in Jamal's zoo photos.
Given that Jamal's phone can hold 1,800 photos, we can set up the equation 6x = 1,800.
Solving for x, we find that x = 1,800 / 6 = 300.
Substituting this value back into the equation x = 50 * number of ducks in Jamal's zoo photos, we can solve for the number of ducks in Jamal's zoo photos.
300 = 50 * number of ducks in Jamal's zoo photos.
Dividing both sides by 50, we find that the number of ducks in Jamal's zoo photos is 300 / 50 = 6.
Therefore, Jamal can see 6 ducks in the photos he took at the zoo.

",Question: 凯蒂以 7 茶匙糖和 13 杯水的比例泡咖啡。如果她使用的糖和水一共 120 茶匙和杯，请计算她使用了多少茶匙的糖。,42,"Step-by-Step Answer: 
The ratio of sugar to water is 7 teaspoons to 13 cups.
If the total amount of sugar and water used is 120 teaspoons and cups, respectively, we can set up the following equation:

7x + 13x = 120

Combining like terms, we get:

20x = 120

Dividing both sides by 20, we find:

x = 6

Therefore, Katie used 7 teaspoons of sugar for each x, and since x is 6, she used a total of 7 * 6 = 42 teaspoons of sugar.

There are 27 unicorns left in the world. One-third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. 
To find out how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we need to calculate one-third of 27.

",Question: 在 20 辆可供出租的汽车中，有 12 辆是自动挡汽车，4 辆是手动挡汽车，其余的是半自动挡汽车。半自动挡汽车的百分比是多少？,20,"Step-by-Step Answer: There are a total of 20 cars available for rent. Out of these, 12 are automatic transmission cars and 4 are manual transmission cars. To find the percentage of semi-automatic transmission cars, we need to subtract the number of automatic and manual transmission cars from the total number of cars and then calculate the percentage.

Total number of semi-automatic transmission cars = Total number of cars - Number of automatic transmission cars - Number of manual transmission cars
Total number of semi-automatic transmission cars = 20 - 12 - 4
Total number of semi-automatic transmission cars = 4

To calculate the percentage, we divide the number of semi-automatic transmission cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100.

Percentage of semi-automatic transmission cars = (Number of semi-automatic transmission cars / Total number of cars) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic transmission cars = (4 / 20) * 100
Percentage of semi-automatic transmission cars = 20

",Question: 蜂巢中有 700 只蜜蜂。工蜂的数量是幼蜂的两倍，幼蜂的数量是蜂后的两倍。工蜂有多少只？,400,"Step-by-Step Answer: Let's start with the number of queen bees. If the number of worker bees is twice the number of larvae, and the number of larvae is twice the number of queen bees, then we can set up the equation: larvae = 2 * queen bees. 

Next, we know that the number of worker bees is twice the number of larvae. So we can substitute the value of larvae into the equation: worker bees = 2 * (2 * queen bees) = 4 * queen bees.

We also know that the total number of bees in the hive is 700. So we can set up another equation: queen bees + larvae + worker bees = 700.

Substituting the value of worker bees from the previous equation, we get: queen bees + 2 * queen bees + 4 * queen bees = 700.

Combining like terms, we have: 7 * queen bees = 700.

Dividing both sides of the equation by 7, we find: queen bees = 100.

Finally, we can substitute the value of queen bees into the equation for worker bees: worker bees = 4 * 100 = 400.

Therefore, there are 400 worker bees. The answer is 400",True

The cost of an adult ticket is $12 and the cost of a child ticket is $10. 
Brittany's mom gave the cashier money for 1 child ticket and 1 adult ticket, and received $8 in change. 
Let's assume Brittany's mom gave the cashier x dollars. 
The cost of the child ticket is $10, so the cost of the adult ticket is $12. 
Therefore, the total cost of the tickets is $10 + $12 = $22. 
If Brittany's mom gave x dollars and received $8 in change, then she gave x - $8 to the cashier. 
So, x - $8 = $22. 
To find the value of x, we can add $8 to both sides of the equation: 
x - $8 + $8 = $22 + $8 
This simplifies to: 
x = $30 
Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30.

Tim lives 2 miles away from school and rides his skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute. To find out how long the winner will wait at their own house before the loser finishes the race, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to reach their house. 

For Steve:
Distance = 3 miles = 3 * 5280 feet = 15840 feet
Time = Distance / Speed = 15840 feet / 440 feet per minute = 36 minutes

For Tim:
Distance = 2 miles = 2 * 5280 feet = 10560 feet
Time = Distance / Speed = 10560 feet / 264 feet per minute = 40 minutes

Since Steve finishes the race in 36 minutes and Tim finishes in 40 minutes, the winner will wait for 40 - 36 = 4 minutes at their own house before the loser finishes the race.

To find the total length of all the breads, we need to calculate the length of each type of bread and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the length of the bread rolls:
Each bread roll is 4 inches long.
Bill makes 300 bread rolls.
So the total length of the bread rolls is 4 inches x 300 = 1200 inches.

Next, let's calculate the length of the chocolate croissants:
Each chocolate croissant is 6 inches long.
Bill makes 120 chocolate croissants.
So the total length of the chocolate croissants is 6 inches x 120 = 720 inches.

Finally, let's calculate the length of the baguettes:
Each baguette is 2 feet long, which is equal to 24 inches.
Bill makes 60 baguettes.
So the total length of the baguettes is 24 inches x 60 = 1440 inches.

Now, let's add up the lengths of all the breads:
1200 inches (bread rolls) + 720 inches (chocolate croissants) + 1440 inches (baguettes) = 3360 inches.

Therefore, the total length of all the",False

",Question: 塞特的年龄是布鲁克的两倍。两年后，他们的年龄总和将为 28 岁。塞特今年几岁？,16,"Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume Seth's age is x years. According to the given information, Brooke's age is twice Seth's age, so Brooke's age is 2x years. 

In two years, Seth's age will be x + 2 years and Brooke's age will be 2x + 2 years. 

According to the second statement, the sum of their ages in two years will be 28 years. So, we can write the equation: (x + 2) + (2x + 2) = 28. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 3x + 4 = 28. 

Subtracting 4 from both sides, we get 3x = 24. 

Dividing both sides by 3, we get x = 8.

- Sally #2 is 3 years older than Sally #4.
- Sally #2's age is twice the age of Sally #4.
- Sally #32 is the same age as Sally #4, and Sally #32 is 8 years old.

- Sally #2's age is 8 + 3 = 11 years old.
- Sally #4's age is also 8 years old.
- Sally #2's age is twice the age of Sally #4, so the total age of Sally #2 and Sally #4 is 11 + 8 = 19 years old.

To find out how much money they spent on lemons, we need to calculate the cost of making one gallon of lemonade. 
They need $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so the total cost of making one gallon of lemonade is $3 + $2 = $5. 
They can make 20 cups of lemonade from one gallon, and they sell each cup for $0.50. 
So, the total revenue from one gallon of lemonade is 20 cups * $0.50/cup = $10. 
Their profit is $25, so the total revenue must be $25 + $5 (cost) = $30. 
To find out how much money they spent on lemons, we need to subtract the cost of sugar from the total cost. 
The cost of sugar is $2, so the cost of lemons is $30 - $2 = $28. 
Therefore, they spent $28 on lemons.

One team runs with a precise time of 55 seconds per 400 meters. The other team is not as consistent, with the first runner taking 60 seconds and each subsequent runner being 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. 

For the first team, each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds, so the total time for the team is 4 * 55 = 220 seconds. 

For the second team, the first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds (60 - 3), the third runner takes 54 seconds (57 - 3), and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds (54 - 3). So the total time for the second team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

To find the percentage difference between the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 and the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers, we need to calculate the probabilities of each event first.

1. Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:
A standard six-sided die has 6 possible outcomes, with numbers ranging from 1 to 6. Out of these 6 outcomes, there are 3 numbers greater than 3 (4, 5, and 6). Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 or 1/2.

2. Probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers:
To calculate this probability, we need to consider the possible outcomes of rolling two dice consecutively. Each die has 3 even numbers (2, 4, and 6) out of 6 possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability of rolling an even number on the first die is 3/6 or 1/2. Since the second die is rolled consecutively, the probability of rolling an even number on the second die is also 1/2. To find the probability of both events occurring, we multiply the probabilities together: (1/2) * (1/",False

Let's assume the number of mice in each cage is x.
There are 3 cages of mice, so the total number of mice is 3x.
Each mouse gets 6 straws, so the total number of straws for the mice is 6 * 3x = 18x.

There are 10 cages of hamsters, so the total number of hamsters is 10.
Each hamster gets 5 straws, so the total number of straws for the hamsters is 5 * 10 = 50.

There is 1 cage of rabbits, and they get 20 straws.

The total number of straws given to all the animals is 18x + 50 + 20 = 18x + 70.

According to the question, the total number of straws given is 160.

So, we can set up the equation: 18x + 70 = 160.

Solving this equation, we get: 18x = 90.

Dividing both sides by 18, we get: x = 5.

Therefore, there are 5 mice in each cage.

The merchant bought each bag of wheat for $20, so the total cost of the wheat is 20x dollars. 

The cost of transporting each bag of wheat from the farm to the warehouse is $2, so the total transportation cost is 2x dollars. 

The merchant sold each bag of wheat for $30, so the total revenue from selling the wheat is 30x dollars. 

The total profit the merchant made is the revenue minus the cost, which is 30x - (20x + 2x) = 30x - 22x = 8x dollars. 

We know that the total profit is $400, so we can set up the equation 8x = 400. 

Solving for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 8: x = 400 / 8 = 50. 

Therefore, the merchant sold 50 bags of wheat.

In addition, they played 2 different amusement rides, which cost 33 * 2 = 66 dollars in total.

John received a cash reward of 5,000 dollars and a 5% salary increase as part of the award. 

To calculate the cash reward, we multiply 5,000 by 1, which equals 5,000 dollars. 

To calculate the salary increase, we multiply John's weekly earnings of 2,000 by 5% (0.05), which equals 100 dollars. 

So, the total amount John earned from the cash reward and salary increase is 5,000 + 100 = 5,100 dollars.

Brinley has taken 5 exams and his scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. To calculate his average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of exams. So, 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438. 
Since there are 6 exams in total, we need to find out the minimum score that Brinley can get in the 6th exam in order to achieve an average score of 93. 
To do that, we need to subtract the sum of the scores from the target average multiplied by the number of exams. So, (93 * 6) - 438 = 150.

So the total cost of the jacket and 2 pairs of shoes is 30 + (2 * 20) = $70. 

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits the neighbor's children, and she babysat them 4 times. So she earned a total of 5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting.

Sara's parents pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn. Let's say she needs to mow the lawn x times to afford the jacket and shoes. So she will earn a total of 4 * x = $4x from mowing the lawn.

Before babysitting, Sara already had $10 saved. So in total, she has 10 + 20 + 4x = $30 + 4x.

To afford the jacket and shoes, Sara needs to have at least $70. So we can set up the equation 30 + 4x ≥ 70.

Solving this equation, we get 4x ≥ 40, which simplifies to x ≥ 10.

Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn at least 10 times to afford the jacket and shoes",True

",Question: 杰瑞有一群鸡。红鸡每天下 3 个蛋，白鸡每天下 5 个蛋。杰瑞每天收集 42 个鸡蛋。如果他的白鸡比红鸡多两只，他有多少只红鸡？,4,"Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume the number of red chickens is R and the number of white chickens is W. 
Each red chicken lays 3 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs laid by red chickens is 3R.
Each white chicken lays 5 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs laid by white chickens is 5W.
Jerry collects 42 eggs per day, so we can write the equation: 3R + 5W = 42.
We also know that the number of white chickens is 2 more than the number of red chickens, so we can write another equation: W = R + 2.
Now we can solve these two equations to find the number of red chickens.
Substitute the value of W from the second equation into the first equation: 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42.
Simplify the equation: 3R + 5R + 10 = 42.
Combine like terms: 8R + 10 = 42.
Subtract 10 from both sides: 8R = 32.
Divide both sides by 8: R = 4.
Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.
The answer is 4",True

Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find the time it takes for him to walk the perimeter of the park, we divide the perimeter by his speed. 15 miles / 3 miles per hour = 5 hours.

Let's assume that the number of customers on the first day is x.
On the second day, the number of customers increased by 50, so it became x + 50.
On the third day, the total number of customers is given as 500.
So, the equation becomes x + (x + 50) + 500 = 500.
Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 50 = 500.
Subtracting 50 from both sides, we get 2x = 450.

Therefore, on the third day, there were 225 + 50 = 275 customers.

Let's assume the amount of water in the small pool is x gallons.
4 minutes ago, the amount of water in the large pool was 2x gallons.
Since both pools are being emptied at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, in 4 minutes, the large pool would have lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water.
Now, the amount of water in the large pool is 2x - 16 gallons.
According to the given information, the amount of water in the large pool is four times the amount in the small pool.
So, 2x - 16 = 4x.
Simplifying the equation, we get 2x = 16.
Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 8.
Therefore, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water.

Carmen also completed 8 sudoku puzzles, and each puzzle took 5 minutes to complete. So, the total time spent on sudoku puzzles is 8 * 5 = 40 minutes.

To find the total time Carmen spent playing games, we add the time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles: 30 + 40 = 70 minutes.

Therefore, Carmen spent a total of 70 minutes playing games.

Mike used to have 5 pen pals. 2 of them are no longer pen pals. That means he currently has 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals.
Each person sends 2 letters per week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So in total, Mike receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters per week.
To respond to each letter, Mike takes 6 minutes per page. Since each letter is 5 pages long, it takes him 6 * 5 = 30 minutes to respond to each letter.
In total, Mike spends 30 minutes per letter and he receives 6 letters per week. So he spends 30 * 6 = 180 minutes per week writing letters.
To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. So Mike spends 180 / 60 = 3 hours per week writing letters.

According to the given information, the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is equal to twice the number of fish in each aquarium. 

So, the difference in the number of snails is 32 - 4 = 28. This is equal to 2x. 

Therefore, 2x = 28.

x = 28 / 2 = 14. 

So, each aquarium has 14 fish.

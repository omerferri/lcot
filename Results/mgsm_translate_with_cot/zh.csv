He bought a house for $80,000 and invested $50,000 in renovations. This increased the value of the house by 150%. How much profit did he make?

1. The initial cost of the house was $80,000.

5. The total value of the house after renovations is the sum of the initial value and the increase in value: $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.
6. To calculate the profit, we subtract the total cost (initial cost + renovation cost) from the total value: $200,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000) = $70,000.

4. To calculate the profit each year, we subtract the cost of watering and fertilizing from the earnings from selling lemons: $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.
5. Carlos needs to earn back the initial cost of $90, so he needs to earn $90 / $7.5 = 12 years.
6. Therefore, Carlos needs to wait for 12 years to start making money from this lemon tree.",False

She sold one-third of her vacuum cleaners in the green house, sold 2 more in the red house, and sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners in the orange house. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, how many vacuum cleaners did she have initially?

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume Melanie initially had x vacuum cleaners. 
She sold one-third of her vacuum cleaners in the green house, which is (1/3)x vacuum cleaners.
In the red house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners, so she sold a total of (1/3)x + 2 vacuum cleaners.
After that, she sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners in the orange house, which is ((1/3)x + 2)/2 vacuum cleaners.
If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, we can set up the equation: ((1/3)x + 2)/2 = 5.
To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2: (1/3)x + 2 = 10.
Next, subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: (1/3)x = 8.

His financial advisor speculates that the jewelry market will increase by 2.5%, while the electronic products market will also increase by 1.2% in the same month. If this businessman expects to maximize his profit by making a choice, what will the profit be?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
To calculate the profit, we need to consider the increase in value for both the jewelry and electronic products.

For the jewelry:
2.5% of $5,000 = $125
So, the value of the jewelry at the end of the month will be $5,000 + $125 = $5,125.

For the electronic products:
1.2% of $8,000 = $96
So, the value of the electronic products at the end of the month will be $8,000 + $96 = $8,096.

To calculate the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the final value:
Profit = ($5,125 + $8,096) - ($5,000 + $8,000)

Step-by-Step Answer: 
To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to calculate her earnings as a teacher and as a coach separately, and then add them together.

As a teacher:
Jill works 35 hours per week as a teacher, so her weekly earnings as a teacher are 35 hours * $20/hour = $700.

Since she works 50 weeks per year, her annual earnings as a coach are $450/week * 50 weeks = $22,500.

Step-by-Step Answer: The book was purchased at 75% of the original price. Let's assume the original price of the book is x dollars. 

75% of x is equal to $19.50. 

So, we can set up the equation:

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

However, she had to choose between the boots and a pair of heels that cost $5 less than the total price of the boots and two other pairs of heels. If one pair of heels costs $33 and the other pair is priced at twice that price, what is the price of the boots?

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's first find the price of the other pair of heels. Since one pair costs $33, the other pair is priced at $33 * 2 = $66. 

Now, we know that the total price of the boots and the two pairs of heels is $5 more than the price of the boots. Let's represent the price of the boots as x. 

So, the total price of the boots and the two pairs of heels is x + $33 + $66 = x + $99. 

According to the given information, this total price is $5 more than the price of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + $99 = x + $5. 

To solve for x, we can subtract x from both sides of the equation: $99 = $5.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Let's assume Daryl's age is 7x and Aaron's age is 11x, where x is a common factor.
2. According to the given information, 7x + 11x = 162.
3. Combining like terms, we get 18x = 162.
4. Dividing both sides of the equation by 18, we find that x = 9.
5. Now we can calculate Aaron's current age by substituting x back into the equation: 11x = 11 * 9 = 99.

The second person's guess is 20 more than half of the first person's guess. The third person's guess is 25% more than the first person's guess. What is the average of their guesses?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The first person's guess is 80 jelly beans.
The second person's guess is 20 more than half of the first person's guess, which is (80/2) + 20 = 60 jelly beans.
The third person's guess is 25% more than the first person's guess, which is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 100 jelly beans.

To find the average of their guesses, we add up all the guesses and divide by the number of people (which is 3 in this case).

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume that Grace has x gold coins. Since she has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, she must have x - 30 silver coins. 

The total number of coins Grace has is the sum of her gold and silver coins, which is x + (x - 30) = 110. 

Combining like terms, we get 2x - 30 = 110. 

Adding 30 to both sides of the equation, we get 2x = 140. 

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 70.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
On the first day, John runs for 3 hours, so he covers a distance of 3 * x miles, where x is his running speed in miles per hour.
On the second day, he runs for half of the first day's time, which is 3/2 hours. So he covers a distance of (3/2) * x miles.
On the third day, he also runs for half of the first day's time, which is 3/2 hours. So he covers a distance of (3/2) * x miles.

In total, John runs 60 miles every week. So we can set up the equation:
3x + (3/2)x + (3/2)x = 60

If she can jump 3 miles per hour, then in 6 hours, she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. How far did she travel?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Dana spends one-third of the time running, which is 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours.
Dana spends two-thirds of the time walking, which is 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours.

Dana's running speed is four times her walking speed, so her walking speed is 3 miles per hour / 4 = 0.75 miles per hour.
In 2 hours of running, she travels 2 hours * 3 miles per hour = 6 miles.
In 4 hours of walking, she travels 4 hours * 0.75 miles per hour = 3 miles.

Step-by-Step Answer: Each serving of potato chips contains 250 calories, and you have consumed 1,800 calories already. That means you have 2,000 - 1,800 = 200 calories left for the day. 

Since there are 5 servings in a bag of potato chips, the total calories in the bag is 250 * 5 = 1,250 calories. 

To find out how many grams of potato chips you can still eat, we need to calculate the calories per gram. The bag weighs 300 grams, so the calories per gram is 1,250 / 300 = 4.17 calories per gram.

This is her regular job. On average, it takes her 4 hours to research and write one blog post. Last week, she wrote 5 blog posts on Monday. The number of blog posts she wrote on Tuesday was 2/5 times more than Monday. The number of blog posts she wrote on Wednesday was twice as many as Tuesday. Please calculate the total time she spent writing blog posts during these three days.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
On Monday, she wrote 5 blog posts, which took 5 * 4 = 20 hours.
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 * 5 = 2 blog posts more than Monday.
So, she wrote 5 + 2 = 7 blog posts on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many blog posts as Tuesday, which is 2 * 7 = 14 blog posts.
This took her 14 * 4 = 56 hours.
Therefore, the total time she spent writing blog posts during these three days is 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours",True

The price of red ties is 50% higher than the price of blue ties. He spent $200 on each blue tie that costs $40. How much money did he spend on ties?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Let's assume that John bought x blue ties.
2. Since he bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2x red ties.
3. The price of each blue tie is $40, so he spent 40x dollars on blue ties.
4. The price of each red tie is 50% higher than the price of blue ties, which means it is $40 + 50% of $40 = $40 + $20 = $60.
5. He bought 2x red ties, so he spent 60 * 2x = 120x dollars on red ties.
6. In total, he spent 40x + 120x = 160x dollars on ties.
7. We know that he spent $200 on each blue tie, so 40x = 200.
8. Solving for x, we find that x = 200 / 40 = 5.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
To find the number of pieces Tracy got, we need to convert the measurements to the same unit. 
1 foot is equal to 12 inches, so 4 feet is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 inches. 
Now we can divide the total length of the wire by the length of each piece to find the number of pieces. 
48 inches / 6 inches = 8 pieces. 
Therefore, Tracy got 8 pieces of wire.",True

",Question: 汤姆的船每小时行驶 10 英里。他从下午 1 点航行到下午 4 点。然后，他以每小时 6 英里的速度返航。他返航需要多长时间？,5,"Translation to English: Question: Tom's boat travels at a speed of 10 miles per hour. He sails from 1 pm to 4 pm. Then, he returns at a speed of 6 miles per hour. How long does it take for him to return? 

Step-by-Step Answer: Tom sails for a total of 3 hours (from 1 pm to 4 pm). During this time, he travels at a speed of 10 miles per hour. So, the distance he covers is 3 hours * 10 miles per hour = 30 miles. 

When he returns, he travels at a speed of 6 miles per hour. To find the time it takes for him to return, we divide the distance (30 miles) by the speed (6 miles per hour). 

30 miles / 6 miles per hour = 5 hours. 

Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to return.",True

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3,755 pounds.
The maximum weight capacity of the bridge is 5,000 pounds.
To find out how many boxes the truck can carry, we need to subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the maximum weight capacity of the bridge.
5,000 - 3,755 = 1,245 pounds
Each box weighs 15 pounds.

Stephen also added a $4.00 tip. After adding these additional charges, what is the final price Stephen paid for the household items?

Step-by-Step Answer:

Step-by-Step Answer: 
There are 25 oranges in total. 
One of them is bad, so we subtract 1 from the total: 25 - 1 = 24 oranges remaining.
20% of the oranges are unripe, which is 20% of 24: 0.2 * 24 = 4.8 oranges.
Since we can't have a fraction of an orange, we round down to the nearest whole number: 4 unripe oranges.
There are also 2 sour oranges.
To find the number of good oranges, we subtract the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total: 24 - 1 - 4 - 2 = 17 good oranges.
Therefore, there are 17 good oranges.",True

She paid $500 for the materials of the brooch and $800 for the craftsmanship to the jeweler. After that, she paid 10% of the total amount for insurance. How much money did she pay in total?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Janet paid $500 for the materials and $800 for the craftsmanship, so the total amount she paid for those two is $500 + $800 = $1300.
She then paid 10% of the total amount for insurance, which is 10% of $1300.
To calculate 10% of $1300, we can multiply $1300 by 0.1.
$1300 * 0.1 = $130.
Therefore, Janet paid $130 for insurance.

",Question: 索菲亚正在考虑自驾游，她想知道一罐汽油能行驶多长距离。自上次加油以来，她已经行驶了 100 英里，而且她需要加 4 加仑的汽油才能再次把油箱装满。根据她汽车使用手册的说明，她汽车的油箱能装 12 加仑汽油。一罐汽油能让索菲亚行驶多长距离？,300,"Translation to English: Question: Sophia is considering a road trip and wants to know how far she can drive on one tank of gas. Since her last fill-up, she has driven 100 miles and she needs to add 4 gallons of gas to fill up the tank again. According to her car's manual, the gas tank can hold 12 gallons of gas. How far can Sophia drive on one tank of gas?

Step-by-Step Answer: Sophia has already driven 100 miles and needs to add 4 gallons of gas to fill up the tank. This means that she has used up 100 miles of gas. To find out how far she can drive on one tank of gas, we need to calculate the miles per gallon (MPG) of her car. 

To do this, we divide the total distance driven (100 miles) by the total amount of gas used (4 gallons): 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon.

Since her gas tank can hold 12 gallons of gas, we can multiply the MPG by the number of gallons in the tank to find out how far she can drive on one tank of gas: 25 miles per gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles.

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300",True

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Let's start with the number of diamonds, which is given as 175.
The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds, so it would be 175 - 35 = 140 rubies.
The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so it would be 140 * 2 = 280 emeralds.

She opted for a 3-month installment plan with an interest rate of 2% per installment. How much does Sheila have to pay each month for these three months?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Each phone costs $150, and Sheila bought 5 phones, so the total cost is 150 * 5 = $750.
Sheila opted for a 3-month installment plan, so she will have to pay $750 over 3 months.
To calculate the monthly payment, we divide the total cost by the number of months: 750 / 3 = $250.
However, there is also an interest rate of 2% per installment.
To calculate the interest for each installment, we multiply the total cost by the interest rate: 750 * 0.02 = $15.
So, each month Sheila will have to pay $250 + $15 = $265.
Therefore, Sheila has to pay $265 each month for these three months.",False

He noticed that each layer of the sandcastle has an area that is half of the area of the layer below it. If he builds a 4-layer sandcastle and the area of the top layer is 16, what is the average area of one layer?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
If the top layer has an area of 16, then the layer below it must have an area of 16 * 2 = 32.
Similarly, the third layer must have an area of 32 * 2 = 64.
And the bottom layer must have an area of 64 * 2 = 128.

To find the average area of one layer, we need to add up the areas of all the layers and divide by the number of layers.
The total area of all the layers is 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240.
Since there are 4 layers, the average area of one layer is 240 / 4 = 60.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
To find out how much money Vincent can save, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers at the regular price and the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price.

At the regular price, Vincent would need to buy 18/3 = 6 bouquets of 3 flowers. Each bouquet costs $2.50, so 6 bouquets would cost 6 * $2.50 = $15.

At the better price, Vincent would need to buy 18/2 = 9 bouquets of 2 flowers. Each bouquet costs $1, so 9 bouquets would cost 9 * $1 = $9.

Therefore, Vincent can save $15 - $9 = $6 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.",False

",Question: 一支足球队参加了 22 场比赛。他们获胜的比赛比输掉的比赛多 8 场。他们赢了多少场比赛？,15,"Translation to English: Question: A soccer team participated in 22 matches. They won 8 more matches than they lost. How many matches did they win? 

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume the number of matches they won is x. Since they won 8 more matches than they lost, the number of matches they lost would be x - 8. 

According to the question, the total number of matches they participated in is 22. So, we can set up the equation: 

x + (x - 8) = 22 

Simplifying the equation, we get: 

2x - 8 = 22 

Adding 8 to both sides of the equation, we get: 

2x = 30 

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get: 

x = 15 

Therefore, the soccer team won 15 matches.",True

If Li completed the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, how many seconds will Gerald take to complete the 400-meter hurdles after improving his diet?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Li completed the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds.
2. Gerald improved his speed by 10%, which means he can run 10% faster than before.
3. To calculate Gerald's new speed, we need to find 10% of his original speed and add it to his original speed.

Total number of pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Finally, he also drinks a glass of water before going to bed. John does this every weekday, but on weekends, he likes to relax and drink soda during dinner.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
On weekdays, John drinks a glass of water during breakfast, lunch, and dinner, and another glass before bed. So, he drinks 4 glasses of water each weekday.
There are 5 weekdays in a week, so John drinks 4 x 5 = 20 glasses of water on weekdays.
On weekends, John drinks soda during dinner instead of water, so he doesn't drink any water during dinner on weekends.

",Question: 一片雾堤从海洋蔓延到覆盖城市。它每覆盖城市的 3 英里需要 10 分钟。如果这座城市从沿海地带到对面的内陆边缘的距离是 42 英里，雾堤覆盖整座城市需要多少分钟？,140,"Translation to English: Question: A fog bank spreads from the ocean to cover the city. It takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles of the city. If the distance from the coastal area to the opposite inland edge of the city is 42 miles, how many minutes does it take for the fog bank to cover the entire city?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
To find out how many minutes it takes for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we need to calculate the number of 3-mile segments in the 42-mile distance. 

42 miles divided by 3 miles per segment equals 14 segments. 

Since each segment takes 10 minutes to cover, we multiply 14 segments by 10 minutes per segment. 

14 segments multiplied by 10 minutes per segment equals 140 minutes. 

Therefore, it takes 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city.",True

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The volume of each box can be calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height: 5 inches * 6 inches * 4 inches = 120 cubic inches.
However, we need to take into account the thickness of the box's walls. Since the walls are 1 inch thick on all sides, we need to subtract the volume of the walls from the total volume of each box.
The volume of the walls can be calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height of the box, which is 5 inches * 6 inches * 1 inch = 30 cubic inches.
Therefore, the actual volume of each box is 120 cubic inches - 30 cubic inches = 90 cubic inches.
To find the total volume of all 3 boxes, we multiply the volume of each box by the number of boxes: 90 cubic inches * 3 boxes = 270 cubic inches.
The answer is 270 cubic inches.",False

While cooling the cookies, he dropped 5 cookies, and now he has a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry make last year?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Let's assume that Henry made x cookies last year.
This year, Henry wanted to make twice as many as last year, so he intended to make 2x cookies.
But he actually made 15 more cookies than he intended, so he made 2x + 15 cookies.
After dropping 5 cookies, he has 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 cookies left.
We know that he has a total of 110 cookies, so we can set up the equation 2x + 10 = 110.
Solving this equation, we get 2x = 100, which means x = 50.
Therefore, Henry made 50 cookies last year.",True

Step-by-Step Answer: The price of gasoline per gallon is $3.00. The cash rebate per gallon is $0.20. If someone purchases 10 gallons of gasoline, they will receive a cash rebate of 10 * $0.20 = $2.00. 

To calculate the amount of money spent on gasoline after receiving the cash rebate, we subtract the cash rebate from the total cost of gasoline. The total cost of gasoline is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00. 

Therefore, the amount of money spent on gasoline after receiving the cash rebate is $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00. The answer is $28.00.",True

",Question: 凯蒂以 7 茶匙糖和 13 杯水的比例泡咖啡。如果她使用的糖和水一共 120 茶匙和杯，请计算她使用了多少茶匙的糖。,42,"Translation to English: Question: Katie brews coffee with a ratio of 7 teaspoons of sugar to 13 cups of water. If she uses a total of 120 teaspoons and cups of sugar and water, please calculate how many teaspoons of sugar she used.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13. 
Let's assume that Katie used x teaspoons of sugar. 
According to the ratio, the amount of water she used is (13/7) * x cups. 
The total amount of sugar and water used is x + (13/7) * x = (20/7) * x. 
We know that the total amount used is 120 teaspoons and cups, so (20/7) * x = 120. 
To find x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by (7/20): 
x = (7/20) * 120 = 42. 
Therefore, Katie used 42 teaspoons of sugar.",True

Please calculate the total salary of both individuals after four years.

Step-by-Step Answer:

Dillon was sent to this store to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. If each pepper costs $15, how much money will he spend in total?

The price of a watermelon is three times the price of a pepper, so let's assume the price of a pepper is x dollars. Therefore, the price of a watermelon is 3x dollars.

The average consultation time for each patient is 24 minutes. The hospital charges $150 per hour to the doctors and $200 per hour to the patients. How much profit does the hospital make from these consultations?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the average consultation time per patient is 24/60 = 0.4 hours.
2. The hospital charges $150 per hour to the doctors, so for each patient, the hospital pays 0.4 * $150 = $60 to the doctors.

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's represent the number of pink gum balls as ""P"" and the number of blue gum balls as ""B"". According to the given information, we have two equations:

1. P = 4B + 22 (The number of pink gum balls is 22 more than four times the number of blue gum balls)
2. B = 12 (There are 12 blue gum balls)

We can substitute the value of B from equation 2 into equation 1:

P = 48 + 22
P = 70

He already has 3 clients, but is in talks with 5 potential clients and is confident enough to include them in his calculations. Cleaning each client's house will require 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cleaning cloths. Each bottle of bleach costs $2 and each pack of cleaning cloths costs $5. These are his only expenses. Based on his calculations, his total weekly income will reach $92. Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, so how much profit will Kim make each week?

Step-by-Step Answer: To calculate the profit, we need to subtract the total expenses from the total income. 

The total expenses can be calculated by multiplying the number of clients by the cost of bleach and cleaning cloths for each client. 

For 3 clients, the cost of bleach would be 3 * 2 = $6 and the cost of cleaning cloths would be 3 * 5 = $15. So the total expenses for the 3 clients would be 6 + 15 = $21.

Tim's house is 2 miles away from school. If Tim can ride his skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner wait at their own house before the loser finishes the race?

To find out how long the winner will wait at their own house, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to reach their house.

Steve's house is 3 miles away from school, and he rides his bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute. To convert miles to feet, we multiply 3 by 5280 (the number of feet in a mile), so Steve's house is 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet away from school.

Each bread roll is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is 2 feet long. If Bill connects all the finished bread end to end, how many feet long is it in total?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
To find the total length, we need to calculate the length of each type of bread and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the length of the bread rolls:
300 bread rolls * 4 inches per bread roll = 1200 inches

Next, let's calculate the length of the chocolate croissants:
120 croissants * 6 inches per croissant = 720 inches

Finally, let's calculate the length of the baguettes:
60 baguettes * 2 feet per baguette * 12 inches per foot = 1440 inches

Now, let's add up the lengths of all the bread:
1200 inches + 720 inches + 1440 inches = 3360 inches

To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12:
3360 inches / 12 inches per foot =",False

Loxin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which is 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
Loxin caught 2 fewer seahorses than Anakin, which is 6 - 2 = 4 seahorses.

",Question: 如果一袋大理石 20 美元，而且价格每两个月比原价上涨 20%。在 36 个月后，一袋大理石多少钱？,92,"Translation to English: Question: If a bag of marbles is $20 and the price increases by 20% every two months, how much does a bag of marbles cost after 36 months?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The price of the bag of marbles increases by 20% every two months. After 36 months, there are 36/2 = 18 two-month periods.
To calculate the final price, we need to calculate the price increase for each two-month period and add it to the original price.
The price increase for each two-month period is 20% of the previous price, so it is 20/100 * $20 = $4.
For 18 two-month periods, the total price increase is 18 * $4 = $72.
Adding the price increase to the original price, the final price of the bag of marbles after 36 months is $20 + $72 = $92. 
Therefore, a bag of marbles costs $92 after 36 months.",False

The price of the doll is equivalent to the price of 3 toy people, and one toy car costs 4 dollars. If one toy person costs 5 dollars, how much are all the toys worth?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
- The doll's price is equivalent to the price of 3 toy people, so the doll is worth 3 * 5 = 15 dollars.
- One toy car costs 4 dollars, and there are 5 toy cars, so the total value of the toy cars is 4 * 5 = 20 dollars.
- The total value of the toys is the sum of the doll's value, the toy cars' value, and the toy people's value. So, the total value is 15 + 20 + (3 * 5) = 15 + 20 + 15 = 50 dollars.

",Question: 塞特的年龄是布鲁克的两倍。两年后，他们的年龄总和将为 28 岁。塞特今年几岁？,16,"Translation to English: Question: Seth's age is twice Brooke's age. In two years, the sum of their ages will be 28. How old is Seth this year? 

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume Brooke's age is x. According to the given information, Seth's age is twice Brooke's age, so Seth's age is 2x. 

In two years, Brooke's age will be x + 2 and Seth's age will be 2x + 2. 

The sum of their ages in two years will be (x + 2) + (2x + 2) = 3x + 4. 

According to the question, the sum of their ages in two years will be 28, so we can set up the equation 3x + 4 = 28. 

Solving this equation, we get 3x = 24, which means x = 8. 

Therefore, Seth's age this year is 2x = 2 * 8 = 16.

",Question: 比利正在将土豆削皮和切块，准备为他的大型家庭团聚烧烤会制作土豆沙拉。这是一场盛大的活动，所以他得完成 60 颗土豆。土豆都差不多大小，将每颗土豆削皮和切块所用的时间差不多相同。比利将一颗土豆削皮需要大约一分半钟，但将一颗土豆切块只需大约 5 秒钟。比利准备好这些土豆需要多长时间？,95,"Translation to English: Question: Billy is peeling and chopping potatoes to make potato salad for his large family barbecue. It's a big event, so he needs to prepare 60 potatoes. The potatoes are all about the same size, and it takes about the same amount of time to peel and chop each potato. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel one potato, but only about 5 seconds to chop one potato. How long will it take Billy to prepare all these potatoes?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
To peel one potato, it takes Billy about 1.5 minutes. 
To chop one potato, it takes Billy about 5 seconds. 

Billy needs to prepare 60 potatoes. 

To peel all the potatoes, it will take Billy 1.5 minutes x 60 potatoes = 90 minutes. 
To chop all the potatoes, it will take Billy 5 seconds x 60 potatoes = 300 seconds. 

To convert seconds to minutes, we divide by 60. 
300 seconds ÷ 60 = 5 minutes. 

So, it will take Billy a total of 90 minutes (to peel) + 5 minutes (to chop) = 95 minutes to prepare all the potatoes.

",Question: 在撒莱的学校，两名候选人正在竞选班级代表。如果当选者获得 3/4 的票，而且班级内投票的学生总数是 80 人，请计算落选者获得的票数。,20,"Translation to English: Question: In Sally's school, two candidates are running for class representative. If the winner gets 3/4 of the votes and there are a total of 80 students voting in the class, please calculate the number of votes the loser receives.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
To find out the number of votes the loser receives, we first need to calculate the number of votes the winner receives. 

If the winner gets 3/4 of the votes, it means they receive 3/4 * 80 = 60 votes. 

Since there are a total of 80 students voting in the class, the loser will receive the remaining votes. 

Therefore, the loser will receive 80 - 60 = 20 votes.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Let's assume Jane's age is J and Mark's age is M. 
According to the given information, we have two equations:
1) J = M + 2 (Jane is 2 years older than Mark)
2) M - 2 = (J/2) + 5 (Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jane's age)

We can solve these equations to find the values of J and M.

From equation 1, we can substitute the value of J in equation 2:
M - 2 = ((M + 2)/2) + 5

Simplifying the equation:
2M - 4 = M + 4 + 10
2M - M = 18
M = 18

Now, we can substitute the value of M in equation 1 to find J:
J = 18 + 2
J = 20

Therefore, Jane is now 20 years old.",False

Step-by-Step Answer: 

To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes. 

There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die: 4, 5, and 6. So the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 or 1/2.

To find the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes. 

There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die: 2, 4, and 6. So the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 3/6 or 1/2. 

Since we need to roll two consecutive even numbers, the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 1/2.

The mice are kept in 3 cages with the same number of mice in each cage, and each mouse receives 6 straws. The hamsters are kept individually in 10 cages, and each hamster receives 5 straws. In addition, there is one cage for rabbits, and they receive 20 straws. No straw is used anywhere else in the pet store. If 160 straws are distributed to the small rodents, how many mice are there in each cage?

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume there are x mice in each cage. Since there are 3 cages, there are a total of 3x mice. Each mouse receives 6 straws, so the total number of straws for the mice is 6 * 3x = 18x.

There are 10 cages for hamsters, and each hamster receives 5 straws. So the total number of straws for the hamsters is 5 * 10 = 50.

There is one cage for rabbits, and they receive 20 straws.

The total number of straws distributed is 18x + 50 + 20 = 18",False

If it costs $2 to transport each bag of wheat from the farm to the warehouse, and the businessman made a total profit of $400 after selling all the wheat at a price of $30 per bag, how many bags did he sell?

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume the businessman bought x bags of wheat from the farmer. The cost of buying the wheat would be 20x dollars. 

The cost of transporting each bag of wheat from the farm to the warehouse is $2, so the total cost of transportation would be 2x dollars.

The businessman sold each bag of wheat for $30, so the total revenue from selling the wheat would be 30x dollars.

The profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue, so the profit would be 30x - (20x + 2x) = 400 dollars.

Simplifying the equation, we get 30x - 22x = 400.

Combining like terms, we get 8x = 400.

Dividing both sides by 8, we get x = 50.

Therefore, the businessman sold ",True

",Question: 鸭子每周要吃 3.5 磅的昆虫才能存活。如果有一群 10 只鸭子，它们每天需要多少磅昆虫？,5,"Translation to English: Question: Ducks need to eat 3.5 pounds of insects per week to survive. If there is a group of 10 ducks, how many pounds of insects do they need per day? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
To find out how many pounds of insects the group of 10 ducks need per day, we first need to calculate the total amount of insects they need per week. 
Since each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, the total amount of insects needed for the group of 10 ducks per week is 3.5 pounds/duck * 10 ducks = 35 pounds. 
To find out how many pounds of insects they need per day, we divide the total amount needed per week by the number of days in a week. 
There are 7 days in a week, so the group of 10 ducks needs 35 pounds/week / 7 days/week = 5 pounds of insects per day.

If Brinley scored 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 in the first five exams, how many points does he need to score in the sixth exam to achieve an average of 93?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
To find out how many points Brinley needs to score in the sixth exam, we need to calculate the sum of his scores in the first five exams and subtract it from the desired average multiplied by 6 (the total number of exams).

The sum of Brinley's scores in the first five exams is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438.

He did this for 4 weeks, and then he decided to ride his bike only 2 times a week, but each time he rides 60 kilometers, and he did this for 3 weeks. How many kilometers did Michael ride in total?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
For the first 4 weeks, Michael rode his bike 5 times a week, and each time he rode 25 kilometers. So in total, he rode 5 * 25 = 125 kilometers per week. 
For 4 weeks, he rode a total of 125 * 4 = 500 kilometers.

Step-by-Step Answer: Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, so the weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40 = 1000 grams. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candy-coated apple, the weight of each candy-coated apple is 40 / 2 = 20 grams. The weight of the candy-coated apples is 80 * 20 = 1600 grams.

Half a dozen is equal to 6 plates.

The red chickens lay 3 eggs each day, and the white chickens lay 5 eggs each day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume Jerry has x red chickens. Since the white chickens are two more than the red chickens, he has x + 2 white chickens. 

The red chickens lay 3 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs laid by the red chickens is 3x. 
The white chickens lay 5 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs laid by the white chickens is 5(x + 2). 

Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, so we can set up the equation: 3x + 5(x + 2) = 42. 

Simplifying the equation, we get: 3x + 5x + 10 = 42. 
Combining like terms, we get: 8x + 10 = 42.

",Question: 加里喜欢沿着当地公园的边缘散步，这是一座 1.5 英里乘 6 英里的矩形公园。如果他以 3 英里/小时的速度散步，他散步花了多少小时？,5,"Translation to English: Question: Gary likes to take walks along the edge of the local park, which is a rectangular park measuring 1.5 miles by 6 miles. If he walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour, how many hours does he spend walking?

Step-by-Step Answer: To find out how many hours Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the total distance he walks and divide it by his walking speed.

The perimeter of a rectangle is calculated by adding the lengths of all its sides. In this case, the perimeter of the park is (1.5 + 6 + 1.5 + 6) miles = 15 miles.

Since Gary walks along the edge of the park, he walks the entire perimeter. Therefore, he walks a total distance of 15 miles.

To find the time it takes for Gary to walk this distance, we divide the total distance by his walking speed: 15 miles / 3 miles per hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking.",True

The next day, she counted again and found that there were 50 more customers than the first day. If the total number of customers until the third day is 500, how many customers came to the store on the third day?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Let's assume the number of customers on the first day is x.
On the second day, there were 50 more customers than the first day, so the number of customers on the second day is x + 50.
The total number of customers until the third day is 500, so the number of customers on the third day can be calculated as follows:
x + (x + 50) + (x + 50) = 500
3x + 100 = 500
3x = 400
x = 400/3
x ≈ 133.33

Since the number of customers must be a whole number, we can round x to the nearest whole number, which is 133.
Therefore, there were approximately 133 customers who came to the store on the third day.",False

Now, the water level in the big pool is four times that of the small pool. How much water is in the small pool now?

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume the initial water level in the small pool is x gallons. Since the water level in the big pool was twice that of the small pool 4 minutes ago, the water level in the big pool was 2x gallons.

In 4 minutes, both pools will have lost water at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. So, the small pool will have lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water, and the big pool will have lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water as well.

Now, the water level in the big pool is four times that of the small pool. So, the water level in the big pool is 4 * x = 4x gallons.

If she plans to pay $165 per month for 12 months, how much debt will Janice have left at that time?

Step-by-Step Answer: Janice borrowed $2,000. She promised to repay an additional 10% of that amount, which is 10% of $2,000 = $200. So in total, Janice needs to repay $2,000 + $200 = $2,200.

To find the remaining debt, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she needs to repay: $2,200 - $1,980 = $220.

1. Harriet's age is 21 years old.
2. Harriet's age is half of Zack's age, so Zack's age is 21 * 2 = 42 years old.
3. Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, so Adrian's age is 21 * 3 = 63 years old.
4. Three years from now, Harriet will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old.
5. Three years from now, Zack will be 42 + 3 = 45 years old.
6. Three years from now, Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old.
7. The sum of their ages three years from now is 24 + 45 + 66 = 135 years.
8. There are three people, so the average age three years from now is 135 / 3 = 45 years.

He has 30 fire-type cards, 20 grass-type cards, and 40 water-type cards. If he loses 8 water-type cards and buys 14 grass-type cards, what is the probability (rounded to the nearest whole number) of randomly selecting a water-type card?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Initially, James has 40 water-type cards. After losing 8 and buying 14, he will have 40 - 8 + 14 = 46 water-type cards.
The total number of cards James has now is 30 + 20 + 46 = 96 cards.
To calculate the probability of randomly selecting a water-type card, we divide the number of water-type cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100 to get a percentage.
So, the probability is (46 / 96) * 100 = 47.92%.

He is no longer pen pals with 2 of them. They each send 2 letters that are 5 pages long every week. He responds in the same way. He can write one page in 6 minutes. How many hours does he spend writing letters in a week?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Michael originally had 5 pen pals, but he is no longer pen pals with 2 of them. That means he is still pen pals with 5 - 2 = 3 people.
Each person sends 2 letters that are 5 pages long, so in total Michael receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters every week.
Michael responds to each letter in the same way, so he also sends 6 letters every week.
Michael can write one page in 6 minutes, so he spends 6 * 6 = 36 minutes writing one letter.
Since Michael sends 6 letters every week, he spends a total of 36 * 6 = 216 minutes writing letters in a week.
There are 60 minutes in an hour, so Michael spends 216 / 60 = 3.6 hours writing letters in a week.

On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies the next day.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
On Monday, Su ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, who ate 5 cookies. So Su ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.
On Tuesday, Su ate twice as many cookies as her sister, who ate 13 cookies. So Su ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

If 1 cookie contains 200 calories, then Su consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories.

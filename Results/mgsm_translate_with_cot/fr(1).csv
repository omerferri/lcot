The value of the house then increases by 150%. What profit did he make? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Josh buys the house for $80,000 and invests $50,000 in its restoration. 
2. The total cost of the house and restoration is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000. 
3. The value of the house increases by 150%, which means it becomes 150% of its original value. 
4. To calculate the new value, we multiply the original value by 1.5 (150% as a decimal). 
   $130,000 * 1.5 = $195,000.

One glass costs $5, but every second glass costs only 60% of the price. Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. How much will he have to pay to buy them?

The first glass costs $5.

The third glass costs $5. 
The fourth glass costs $3. 
This pattern continues, with every even-numbered glass costing $3 and every odd-numbered glass costing $5.

How many years will it take for Carlos to start making money with his lemon tree? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Carlos needs to calculate the total cost of planting the lemon tree. The cost of planting is $90.
2. Carlos also needs to calculate the annual cost of watering and nourishing the tree. The cost is $3 per year.
3. Carlos needs to calculate the annual revenue from selling the lemons. The tree produces 7 lemons per year, and each lemon is sold for $1.5. So the annual revenue is 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.
4. Carlos needs to calculate the annual profit by subtracting the annual cost from the annual revenue. The annual profit is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.
5. Carlos will start making money when the total profit is greater than or equal to the total cost. So he needs to calculate how many years it will take for the total profit to reach $90.
6. The number of years can be calculated by dividing the total cost by the annual profit. $90 / $7.5 = 12.

During her visit to the green house, she sold one third of her vacuum cleaners, then 2 more at the red house, and finally half of what was left at the orange house. If Mélanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, how many vacuum cleaners did she have initially? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Let's assume Mélanie initially had x vacuum cleaners.
She sold one third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is (1/3)x.
Then she sold 2 more at the red house, which is 2.
After these sales, she had (x - (1/3)x - 2) vacuum cleaners left.
Finally, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is (1/2)(x - (1/3)x - 2).
According to the question, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so we can set up the equation:
(x - (1/3)x - 2) - (1/2)(x - (1/3)x - 2) = 5
Simplifying the equation:
(x - (1/3)x - 2) - (1/2)x + (1/6)x + 1 = 5
Combining like terms:
(6/6)x - (2/6)x - (3/6)x - 1 + 2 = 5

What is the original price of the book? 
Step-by-Step Answer: Kyle paid $19.50 for the book, which was 75% of the original price. Let's represent the original price as ""x"". So, 75% of x is equal to $19.50. We can write this as an equation: 0.75x = $19.50. To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75: x = $19.50 / 0.75 = $26. The answer is $26.",True,152,149,False

If one pair of high heels costs $33 and the other pair costs twice as much, what is the price of the ankle boots in dollars? 

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume the price of the ankle boots is x dollars. The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is (33 + 2x) dollars. According to the given information, the cost of the high heels is five dollars less than the ankle boots, so we can write the equation: (33 + 2x) = (x - 5). 

Simplifying the equation, we get: 33 + 2x = x - 5. 

Subtracting x from both sides, we get: x = -38.

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume that Darell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x. According to the given ratio, the sum of their ages is 7x + 11x = 18x. We know that the sum of their current ages is 162, so we can set up the equation 18x = 162. Solving for x, we find that x = 9.

The first friend estimates 80 candies.
The second friend estimates 20 more than half of the first friend's estimate, which is 20 + (80/2) = 20 + 40 = 60 candies.
The third friend estimates 25% more than the first friend's estimate, which is 80 + (80 * 0.25) = 80 + 20 = 100 candies.

",Gretchen a 110 pièces. Les pièces en or comptent 30 pièces de plus que celles en argent. Combien Gretchen a-t-elle de pièces en or ?,70,"Translation to English: Question: Gretchen has 110 coins. The gold coins count 30 more than the silver coins. How many gold coins does Gretchen have?
Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume Gretchen has x silver coins. According to the information given, the number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins. So, the number of gold coins is x + 30. 
We know that Gretchen has a total of 110 coins, so we can set up the equation: x + (x + 30) = 110. 
Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 30 = 110. 
Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2x = 80. 
Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 40. 
Therefore, Gretchen has 40 silver coins and the number of gold coins is x + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70.

The yogurts are sold at a price of 4 for $5. So for every 4 yogurts, Terry spends $5. 
To find out how much Terry spends on 60 yogurts, we can set up a proportion: 
4 yogurts / $5 = 60 yogurts / x dollars 
Cross multiplying, we get:

On the first day, Jean runs for 3 hours, so he covers a distance of 3 * v miles, where v is his running speed in miles per hour.

If she jumps at a speed of 3 miles per hour, how many miles does she travel in six hours, knowing that she spends 1/3 of the time running and 2/3 walking? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Let's assume that Dana's walking speed is x miles per hour. 
2. According to the given information, Dana's running speed is 4x miles per hour. 
3. Dana's jumping speed is half of her running speed, which is (1/2) * 4x = 2x miles per hour. 
4. Dana spends 1/3 of the time running and 2/3 walking, which means she runs for (1/3) * 6 = 2 hours and walks for (2/3) * 6 = 4 hours. 
5. In 2 hours of running, Dana covers a distance of 2 * (4x) = 8x miles. 
6. In 4 hours of walking, Dana covers a distance of 4 * x = 4x miles. 
7. Adding the distances covered during running and walking, Dana travels a total distance of 8x + 4x = 12x miles in six hours. 
8. Given that Dana's jumping speed is 3 miles per hour, we can set up the equation 2x = 3 to find the value of x.

","Perg, le grand dragon, était assis au sommet du mont Farbo et crachait du feu sur une distance de 1 000 pieds.

Toutefois, lorsque Polly tenait la pierre de saphir, elle pouvait le lancer trois fois plus loin.

Polly could throw the golden javelin, the only weapon capable of piercing the dragon, but only over a distance of 400 feet, well within range of its flames. However, when Polly held the sapphire stone, she could throw it three times as far. Holding the precious stone, at what distance could Polly stay out of reach of the flames while still managing to hit the dragon with the golden javelin? 

Step-by-Step Answer: Without the sapphire stone, Polly can throw the golden javelin up to 400 feet. With the sapphire stone, she can throw it three times as far, which is 400 * 3 = 1200 feet. Since Perg can spew fire up to 1000 feet, Polly needs to be at a distance greater than 1000 feet to stay out of reach of the flames. Therefore, Polly can stay at a distance of 1200 feet from Perg while still being able to hit the dragon with the golden javelin.

If a 300g bag contains 5 servings, how many grams of chips will you eat, knowing that your daily calorie goal is 2,000 and you have already consumed 1,800 calories? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
- Each serving of chips contains 250 calories.
- The bag of chips contains 5 servings.
- So, the total number of calories in the bag of chips is 250 * 5 = 1250 calories.
- Your daily calorie goal is 2,000 calories and you have already consumed 1,800 calories.
- Therefore, you have 2,000 - 1,800 = 200 calories left to consume.
- To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to calculate the number of servings that fit within the remaining 200 calories.
- Each serving is 250 calories, so the number of servings that fit within 200 calories is 200 / 250 = 0.8 servings.
- Since each serving is 300g, you can eat 0.8 * 300 = 240 grams of chips.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Let's first find out how many blue ties Jean bought. He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each, so he bought 200/40 = 5 blue ties.

Since Jean buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

Now let's calculate the cost of the red ties. The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties, which means they cost 40 + (40 * 50/100) = 40 + 20 = $60 each.

Jean bought 10 red ties, so he spent 10 * 60 = $600 on red ties.

How much does Lloyd earn per week with his eggs? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
To find out how much Lloyd earns per week, we need to calculate the total number of dozens of eggs he sells per week and then multiply it by the selling price. 

There are 7 days in a week, so the total number of eggs produced per week is 252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week. 

To find the number of dozens, we divide the total number of eggs by 12: 1764 eggs/week / 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozens/week.

The truck is filled with identical boxes, weighing 15 pounds each. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3,755 pounds. How many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge? 

Step-by-Step Answer: The weight limit of the bridge is 5,000 pounds. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3,755 pounds. To find out how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the weight limit of the bridge. 

5,000 - 3,755 = 1,245 

Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find out how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck, we need to divide the remaining weight limit by the weight of each box.

Step-by-Step Answer:

An interest of 2% will be charged for each unit, so the total interest is $750 * 2% = $15. The total amount Shiela will have to pay is $750 + $15 = $765. Since she has to pay this amount over 3 months, she will have to pay $765 / 3 = $255 each month.

Since he doesn't have any change today, Artie decides to round all his prices to the nearest dollar. If he sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias, and 17 pots of begonias, how much money will he earn?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The price of marigolds is $2.74 per pot. Rounded to the nearest dollar, it becomes $3 per pot.
Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds, so he will earn 12 * $3 = $36 from marigolds.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The highest level has a surface area of 16 square feet. 
The level below it has twice the surface area, so it has 16 * 2 = 32 square feet. 
The level below that has twice the surface area again, so it has 32 * 2 = 64 square feet. 
The lowest level has twice the surface area of the previous level, so it has 64 * 2 = 128 square feet. 
To find the average surface area, we add up the surface areas of all the levels and divide by the number of levels: (16 + 32 + 64 + 128) / 4 = 240 / 4 = 60.

According to the veterinarian, she will have to give him 1 bowl of dog food every day for the first 180 days. Then, she will have to give him 2 bowls every day for the rest of his life. If a bag of dog food represents 110 bowls, how many bags of dog food will Cécilia use during the first year?.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
- For the first 180 days, Cécilia will need 1 bowl of dog food per day.
- So, for the first 180 days, she will need a total of 180 bowls of dog food.
- Since a bag of dog food represents 110 bowls, she will need 180/110 = 1.6363636... bags of dog food for the first 180 days.
- After the first 180 days, she will need 2 bowls of dog food per day.
- There are 365 days in a year, so after the first 180 days, there are 365 - 180 = 185 days left in the year.
- For the remaining 185 days, she will need 2 bowls of dog food per day, which is a total of 185 * 2 = 370 bowls of dog food.
- Since a bag of dog food represents 110 bowls, she will need 370/110 = 3.3636363... bags of dog food for the remaining days of the year.
- Adding the bags of dog food needed for the first 180 days and the remaining days, she will need a total of 1.6363636... + 3.3636363... = 5 bags of dog food for the first year.

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's say the team won x times. Since they won _ times more than they lost, they lost x/_ times. 

The total number of matches played is the sum of the number of wins and the number of losses, which is x + x/_ = 22. 

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by _ to get rid of the fraction: _x + x = 22_. 

Combining like terms, we have (_ + 1)x = 22_. 

Dividing both sides of the equation by (_ + 1), we get x = 22/(_ + 1).

Si 20 adultes et 5 enfants sont présents au pique-nique, combien de kilos de salade de pommes de terre Ted devra-t-il apporter pour espérer nourrir tout le monde ?",225,"Translation to English: Question: Ted the Tyrannosaurus plans to bring a potato salad to the dinosaur picnic. He knows that it will take 10 pounds for one adult dinosaur and half of that amount for a child. If there are 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic, how many kilograms of potato salad will Ted need to bring in order to hope to feed everyone? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
- For 20 adults, Ted will need 10 pounds of potato salad per adult, so 20 * 10 = 200 pounds of potato salad.
- For 5 children, Ted will need half of the amount for an adult, so 10 / 2 = 5 pounds of potato salad per child.
- Therefore, for the 5 children, Ted will need 5 * 5 = 25 pounds of potato salad.
- In total, Ted will need 200 + 25 = 225 pounds of potato salad.
- To convert pounds to kilograms, we divide by 2.2046 (1 pound = 0.4536 kilograms).
- So, Ted will need 225 / 2.2046 = 102.06 kilograms of potato salad.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
To find out how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we need to determine how many sets of 3 miles are in 42 miles. 

42 miles divided by 3 miles is equal to 14 sets of 3 miles. 

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles, it will take 10 minutes multiplied by 14 sets of 3 miles to cover the entire city.

",Jean a 3 boîtes. Chaque boîte mesure 5 x 6 x 4 pouces. Les parois ont 1 pouce d'épaisseur. Quel est le volume intérieur total des 3 boîtes ?,72,"Translation to English: Jean has 3 boxes. Each box measures 5 x 6 x 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick. What is the total interior volume of the 3 boxes? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The dimensions of each box are 5 x 6 x 4 inches. 
To find the interior volume of each box, we need to subtract the volume of the walls. 
The volume of each box without the walls is (5-2) x (6-2) x (4-2) = 3 x 4 x 2 = 24 cubic inches. 
Since Jean has 3 boxes, the total interior volume of the 3 boxes is 3 x 24 = 72 cubic inches. 

The answer is 72 cubic inches.",True,167,166,False

Step-by-Step Answer: On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watched 1 hour each evening, so that's a total of 1 + 1 = 2 hours. On Thursday, he watched one 1-hour episode and one 30-minute show, so that's a total of 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours. On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, so that's a total of 2 + 2 = 4 hours. So far, Frankie has watched 2 + 1.5 + 4 = 7.5 hours of TV. Since he watched a total of 7 hours, that means he must have watched 7.5 - 7 = 0.5 hours on Wednesday.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
- The boat takes 2 liters of water every 10 feet rowed towards the shore.
- Julia traveled 20 feet in 16 seconds.
- To find out how much water the boat took when Julia reached the shore, we need to calculate the number of 10-feet intervals she rowed.
- Since it took her 16 seconds to travel 20 feet, we can calculate the number of 10-feet intervals by dividing 20 by 10, which is 2.
- So, Julia rowed 2 intervals of 10 feet each.

She decides to sell the remaining wood. She has ten boards of 2 x 4 x 10, which cost her $10 each. She also has five boards of 4 x 4 x 10 that she bought for $16 each. If she manages to sell all of them, what will her profit be? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The cost of each 2 x 4 x 10 board is $10, and she has ten of them. So the total cost for these boards is 10 x $10 = $100.
The cost of each 4 x 4 x 10 board is $16, and she has five of them. So the total cost for these boards is 5 x $16 = $80.
The total cost for all the boards is $100 + $80 = $180.
If the prices have increased by 50%, she can sell the boards for 100% + 50% = 150% of their original cost.
Her profit will be the selling price minus the cost price, which is 150% of $180 - $180 = $270 - $180 = $90.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13.
Let's assume that Katy poured 7x teaspoons of sugar and 13x cups of water.
According to the given information, the total number of teaspoons and cups used is 120.
So, we can write the equation as 7x + 13x = 120.
Combining like terms, we get 20x = 120.
Dividing both sides by 20, we find x = 6.
Therefore, Katy poured 7x = 7 * 6 = 42 teaspoons of sugar.

Four years later, this salary had increased and was 40% higher than what he earned initially. If Adrien's and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, and Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago, calculate the total amount of their two salaries four years later.

Step-by-Step Answer: Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000. This salary was 40% higher than what he earned initially, so we can calculate his initial salary by dividing $40,000 by 1.40 (100% + 40%). Adrien's initial salary was $40,000 / 1.40 = $28,571.43.

Adrien's total salary four years later is his initial salary plus the increase. The increase is 40% of his initial salary, which is 0.40 * $28,571.43 = $11,428.57. Therefore, Adrien's total salary four years later is $28,571.43 + $11,428.57 = $40,000.

Since Adrien's total salary four years later is $40,000, and Lylah's salary is 30% lower than Adrien's, we can calculate Lylah's salary as 70% of Adrien's salary. Lylah's salary four years later is 0.70 * $40,000 = $28,000.

The total amount of Adrien's and Lylah's salaries four years later is $40,000 + $28,000 = $68,000.

How much total will he spend if each pepper costs $15?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
- A watermelon costs three times as much as a pepper, so let's say a pepper costs $x. This means a watermelon costs $3x.
- An orange costs 5 times less than a watermelon, so an orange costs $3x/5.
- Dillon is buying 4 watermelons, so the cost of the watermelons will be 4 * $3x = $12x.
- Dillon is buying 20 peppers, so the cost of the peppers will be 20 * $x = $20x.
- Dillon is buying 10 oranges, so the cost of the oranges will be 10 * $3x/5 = $6x.
- The total cost will be the sum of the costs of the watermelons, peppers, and oranges: $12x + $20x + $6x = $38x.
- Each pepper costs $15, so we can substitute $x with $15 in the equation: $38 * $15 = $570.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Nissa hired 60 seasonal workers to play elves.

","Dans un distributeur de bonbons, il y a 22 fois plus de boules de gommes bleues que quatre fois la quantité de boules de gommes roses. S'il y a 12 boules de gommes de bleues, combien y en a-t-il de roses ?",70,"Translation to English: In a candy dispenser, there are 22 times more blue gumballs than four times the amount of pink gumballs. If there are 12 blue gumballs, how many pink gumballs are there?

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume the number of pink gumballs is x. According to the information given, there are 22 times more blue gumballs than four times the amount of pink gumballs. So, the number of blue gumballs is 4x * 22.

Given that there are 12 blue gumballs, we can set up the equation: 4x * 22 = 12.

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4 * 22: x = 12 / (4 * 22).

Simplifying the equation, we get: x = 12 / 88.

Calculating the division, we find that x is approximately 0.136.

Therefore, there are approximately 0.136 pink gumballs.

The answer is approximately 0.136.",False,226,223,False

What is the percentage of semi-automatic cars? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to first determine how many semi-automatic cars there are. 

We know that there are 20 cars in total, and out of those, 12 are automatic and 4 are manual. So, the number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated by subtracting the sum of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars: 

20 - 12 - 4 = 4 

There are 4 semi-automatic cars. 

To find the percentage, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100:

If Charlie has 12 Facebook friends, how many does Jacques have? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Let's assume that Dorothée has x Facebook friends.
Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothée, so Charlie has 3x friends.
Jacques has four times as many friends as Dorothée, so Jacques has 4x friends.

Given that Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation:
3x = 12

To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
x = 12/3
x = 4

Now that we know x, we can find the number of friends Jacques has:
Jacques has 4 times as many friends as Dorothée, so Jacques has 4 * 4 = 16 friends.

If Tim travels on a skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner wait at home before the loser finishes the race? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
To find the time it takes for each person to travel, we need to divide the distance by the speed. 
For Steve: 
Time = Distance / Speed = 3 miles / 440 feet per minute = (3 * 5280 feet) / 440 feet per minute = 15840 feet / 440 feet per minute = 36 minutes

Time = Distance / Speed = 2 miles / 264 feet per minute = (2 * 5280 feet) / 264 feet per minute = 10560 feet / 264 feet per minute = 40 minutes

Si Bill met tous les produits de boulangerie bout à bout, quelle sera leur longueur en pieds ?",280,"Translation to English: Question: Every day, Bill prepares 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes. The rolls measure 4 inches each, the croissants 6 inches each, and the baguettes 2 feet each. If Bill puts all the bakery products end to end, what will be their length in feet? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
To find the total length in feet, we need to convert the measurements to feet. 
1 foot = 12 inches. 

The rolls measure 4 inches each, so in feet, they would be 4/12 = 1/3 feet each. 
The croissants measure 6 inches each, so in feet, they would be 6/12 = 1/2 feet each. 
The baguettes measure 2 feet each. 

Now, we can calculate the total length. 
For the rolls: 300 rolls * (1/3 feet per roll) = 100 feet. 
For the croissants: 120 croissants * (1/2 feet per croissant) = 60 feet. 
For the baguettes: 60 baguettes * 2 feet per baguette = 120 feet. 

Adding up the lengths of all the bakery products, we get: 100 feet + 60 feet + 120 feet = 280 feet.

","Si un sac de billes coûte 20 $ et que le prix de départ augmente de 20 % tous les deux mois, combien coûtera un sac de billes après 36 mois ?",92,"Translation to English: If a bag of marbles costs $20 and the starting price increases by 20% every two months, how much will a bag of marbles cost after 36 months? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The bag of marbles starts at $20. 
After two months, the price increases by 20%, which is 20% of $20 = $4. So the new price is $20 + $4 = $24. 
After four months, the price increases by another 20%, which is 20% of $24 = $4.80. So the new price is $24 + $4.80 = $28.80. 
This pattern continues every two months. 
After 36 months, there are 36/2 = 18 cycles of price increases. 
Each cycle increases the price by $4.80.

Si Jessica veut payer 50 % de plus que le minimum, combien doit-elle payer en un an ?",18000,"Translation to English: Jessica is wondering how much money she needs to pay each month to cover all her debts. The minimum payment for her student loan is $300 per month, for her credit card is $200 per month, and for her mortgage is $500 per month. If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, how much does she need to pay in one year? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The minimum payment for the student loan is $300 per month. If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, she needs to pay an additional 50% of $300, which is $150. So, her monthly payment for the student loan would be $300 + $150 = $450.

The minimum payment for the credit card is $200 per month. If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, she needs to pay an additional 50% of $200, which is $100. So, her monthly payment for the credit card would be $200 + $100 = $300.

The minimum payment for the mortgage is $500 per month. If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, she needs to pay an additional 50% of $500, which is $250. So, her monthly payment for the mortgage would be $500 + $250 = $750.

To calculate the total amount Jessica needs to pay in one year, we need to multiply her monthly payment for each debt by 12 (months in a year) and add them together. 

For the student loan: $450 * 12 = $5400
For the credit card: $300 * 12 = $3600
For the mortgage: $750 * 12 = $9000

Adding them together: $5400 + $3600 + $9000 = $18000

Therefore, Jessica needs to pay $18000 in one year to cover all her debts.

For each gallon, they spend $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar. They make 20 glasses of lemonade and sell them for $0.50 each. If they made a profit of $25, how much did they spend on lemons?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Let's assume they spent x dollars on lemons.
For each gallon, they spend $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar. So, the total cost for each gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.
They made a profit of $25, which means their total revenue is $25 + their total cost.
They made 20 glasses of lemonade and sold them for $0.50 each, so their total revenue is 20 * $0.50 = $10.
Their total cost is the cost per gallon multiplied by the number of gallons they made. Since they made 20 glasses, which is equivalent to 20/16 = 1.25 gallons, their total cost is $5 * 1.25 = $6.25.
Their total revenue is $10 and their total cost is $6.25, so their profit is $10 - $6.25 = $3.75.
Since their profit is $25, we can set up the equation: $3.75x = $25.
Solving for x, we find that x = $25 / $3.75 = 6.67.
Therefore, they spent $6.67 on lemons.

He gives $200 to his daughter for her weekly expenses and $700 to his wife for groceries and other household items. If Zaid earns $6,000 per month, how much money will he have left after all these expenses and donations? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Zaid earns $6,000 per month. 
He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is (1/4) * $6,000 = $1,500. 
He spends 1/3 of his salary on fuel, which is (1/3) * $6,000 = $2,000.

After the donation, he has $2,500 - $1,250 = $1,250 left. 
He gives $200 to his daughter and $700 to his wife, which is $200 + $700 = $900 in total.

1. Bo has 40 crabs.
2. Monique has 4 crabs less than Bo, so Monique has 40 - 4 = 36 crabs.
3. Rani has ten more crabs than Monique, so Rani has 36 + 10 = 46 crabs.
4. The total number of crabs is 40 + 36 + 46 = 122.

If Jan is 30 years old, how old is Jean? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Let's start by finding Marc's age. Two years ago, Marc was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. So, half of Jan's age two years ago was (30-2)/2 = 14 years. Therefore, Marc's age two years ago was 14 + 5 = 19 years. 

Since Jean is two years older than Marc, Jean's age two years ago was 19 + 2 = 21 years.

One of the teams is very well-trained and each of its members completes their 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. The other team is less well-trained. Their first runner completes 400 meters in 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. Based on this information, in how many seconds will the faster team win? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The well-trained team completes each 400 meters in 55 seconds. Since there are four runners in total, the total time for the well-trained team to complete the race is 4 * 55 = 220 seconds.

The less well-trained team's first runner completes 400 meters in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. So the second runner completes 400 meters in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds, the third runner completes it in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds, and the fourth runner completes it in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

To find the total time for the less well-trained team, we add up the times for each runner: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

Since the well-trained team completes the race in 220 seconds and the less well-trained team completes it in 222 seconds, the faster team will win the race.

What is the probability (in percentage) that he gets a number greater than 3 rather than an even number twice in a row?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
To find the probability, we need to determine the number of favorable outcomes and the total number of possible outcomes.

1. Number greater than 3: There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die, which are 4, 5, and 6.

2. Even number: There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die, which are 2, 4, and 6.

3. Probability of getting a number greater than 3: Since there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes, the probability is 3/6 or 1/2.

4. Probability of getting an even number twice in a row: Since there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes, the probability is 3/6 or 1/2.

5. To find the probability of getting a number greater than 3 rather than an even number twice in a row, we need to subtract the probability of getting an even number twice in a row from the probability of getting a number greater than 3.

6. Probability of getting a number greater than 3 rather than an even number twice in a row: (1/2) - (1/2) = 0.

The rats are divided into 3 cages in equal-sized groups and each rat receives 6 pieces of straw. There are 10 hamster cages. Each hamster is alone in its cage and receives 5 pieces of straw. There is also a rabbit enclosure where 20 pieces of straw are distributed. No straw is used elsewhere in the store. If 160 pieces of straw were distributed to the small rodents, how many rats are there in each cage?.

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's start by calculating the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the rats. Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw and there are 3 cages, so the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the rats is 6 x 3 = 18.

Next, let's calculate the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the hamsters. Each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw and there are 10 cages, so the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the hamsters is 5 x 10 = 50.

Finally, let's calculate the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the rabbits. The rabbit enclosure receives 20 pieces of straw.

Adding up all the pieces of straw distributed, we have 18 + 50 + 20 = 88.

Since 160 pieces of straw were distributed in total, we can subtract the pieces of straw distributed to the small rodents from the total to find the remaining pieces of straw. 160 - 88 = 72.

Since each rat receives 6 pieces of straw, we can divide the remaining pieces of straw by 6 to find the number of rats. 72 / 6 = 12.

Therefore, there are 12 rats in each cage. The answer is 12.",False,375,367,False

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume the merchant bought x bags of wheat from the farmer. The cost of transportation for each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost is 2x dollars. The selling price for each bag is $30, so the total revenue from selling the bags is 30x dollars. The profit is the difference between the revenue and the cost, which is 30x - (20x + 2x) = 30x - 22x = 8x dollars. We know that the profit is $400, so we can set up the equation 8x = 400.

He gives six tests per semester. He allows students to drop the lowest average of each semester. If, on the first five tests, Brinley got scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86, what score does she need on the sixth test to have an average of 93? 

Step-by-Step Answer: Brinley has taken five tests and wants to have an average of 93. To find the score she needs on the sixth test, we need to calculate the sum of her scores on the first five tests and subtract it from the desired average multiplied by six (since there are six tests in total). 

The sum of her scores on the first five tests is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438. 

To have an average of 93, the sum of her scores on all six tests should be 93 * 6 = 558.

The total cost of the plates is 3 * 6000 = $18,000.
Now, let's calculate the cost of twenty dozens of cups. One dozen is equal to 12 cups, so twenty dozens is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

Si Sarah avait déjà 10 $ d'économies avant de commencer à faire du baby-sitting, combien de fois doit-elle tondre la pelouse avant de pouvoir s'offrir la veste et les chaussures ?",10,"Translation to English: Sara wants to buy a new jacket and 2 pairs of shoes. The jacket she has chosen costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20. Sara babysits the neighbor's children 4 times and earns $5 each time. Her parents give her $4 each time she mows the lawn. If Sara already had $10 in savings before starting babysitting, how many times does she have to mow the lawn before she can afford the jacket and shoes? 

Step-by-Step Answer: The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost of the jacket and shoes is 30 + (2 * 20) = $70. 

Sara earns $5 each time she babysits and she babysits 4 times, so she earns a total of 5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting. 

Sara's parents give her $4 each time she mows the lawn and she needs to earn $70, so she needs to mow the lawn 70 / 4 = 17.5 times. 

Since Sara cannot mow the lawn a fraction of a time, she needs to mow the lawn 18 times in order to afford the jacket and shoes. 

The answer is 18.",False,264,257,False

Red hens produce 3 eggs per day, and white hens produce 5 eggs per day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. If he has two more white hens than red hens, how many red hens does he have?

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume Jerry has x red hens. Since the white hens are two more than the red hens, he has x + 2 white hens. 

The red hens produce 3 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs produced by the red hens is 3x. 
The white hens produce 5 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs produced by the white hens is 5(x + 2). 

Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, so we can set up the equation: 
3x + 5(x + 2) = 42

Simplifying the equation: 
3x + 5x + 10 = 42
8x + 10 = 42
8x = 32
x = 4

Therefore, Jerry has 4 red hens.

Now, it has four times as much. What is the amount of water in the small pool now? 

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago was x gallons. Since the large pool had twice as much water, it had 2x gallons. 

In 4 minutes, both pools would have lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water each. 

Now, the large pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, the amount of water in the large pool now is 4 * x gallons. 

Since both pools have been losing water at the same rate, the difference in the amount of water between the two pools remains the same. 

Therefore, 4 * x - x = 16 gallons. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 3x = 16.

He has a gift card worth $5.00 that he uses at the checkout. How much does he have left to pay? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The basic burrito costs $6.50. 
He adds $2 for meat, $1.00 for cheese, $1.00 for avocado, and 2 sauces at $0.25 each. 
So the total cost of the burrito is $6.50 + $2 + $1.00 + $1.00 + (2 * $0.25) = $11.00. 
He chooses the premium option for an additional $3.00, so the total cost becomes $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00. 
He has a gift card worth $5.00, so the amount he has left to pay is $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

","Griffin avait 24 frites mais Kyle en a pris 5. Billy en a pris deux fois plus que Kyle.

Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, then Colby took 3 fewer fries from Griffin than the number of fries Kyle had taken. If, in the end, Griffin had 27 fries, how many fries did Ginger give to Griffin?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Griffin started with 24 fries. Kyle took 5 fries, so Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.
Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries.
After Billy took fries, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.
Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, so Griffin had 9 + handful of fries = 27 fries.
Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 27 - 9 = 18 fries.

The difference between the quantities of snails in the two aquariums is equal to twice the sum of the fish in the two aquariums. If the two aquariums contain the same number of fish, how many fish are there in each aquarium?.

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume the number of fish in each aquarium is x. The difference between the quantities of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28. According to the given information, this difference is equal to twice the sum of the fish in the two aquariums, which is 2 * x + 2 * x = 4x. So we have the equation 4x = 28. Solving for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 28 / 4 = 7. Therefore, there are 7 fish in each aquarium. The answer is 7.",True,208,210,False

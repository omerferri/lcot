This increased the value of the house by 150%. How much profit did he make? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Josha bought the house for $80,000.
2. He spent $50,000 on renovations.
3. The renovations increased the value of the house by 150%, which means the value increased by 150/100 * $80,000 = $120,000.

5. To calculate the profit, we subtract the total cost (purchase price + renovation cost) from the new value of the house: $200,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000) = $200,000 - $130,000 = $70,000.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10 for the first 40 hours she works each week.

How many years will it take before he starts making a profit from the lemon tree? 

Step-by-Step Answer: Carlos needs to calculate the total cost of planting the tree and the annual expenses. The total cost is $90. The annual expenses are $3. 

Carlos needs to calculate the annual income from selling lemons. The tree will bear 7 lemons each year, and he can sell each lemon for $1.5. So, the annual income is 7 lemons * $1.5 = $10.5. 

Carlos needs to calculate how many years it will take for the annual income to cover the total cost and annual expenses.

After that, she sold half of the remaining ones in the orange house, which is (1/2)(x - (1/3)x - 2). So, the equation becomes (1/2)(x - (1/3)x - 2) = 5.

Mshauri wake wa kifedha anakadiria kuwa soko la mapambo ya kito litapanda hadi 2.5% huku soko la vifaa vya elektroniki litapanda hadi 1.2% ndani ya mwezi huo mmoja. Iwapo mfanyabiashara huyo anataka kuwa na faida za juu zaidi mwishoni mwa mwezi huu kwa kufanya chaguo, hii itakuwa faida ya kiasi gani?",125,"Translation to English: Question: A business owner wants to make a purchasing decision between two options: jewelry worth $5,000 or electronic devices worth $8,000. Their financial advisor estimates that the jewelry market will increase by 2.5% while the electronic market will increase by 1.2% within that month. If the business owner wants to have the highest profit at the end of the month by making a choice, what would be the profit amount?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. For the jewelry option, a 2.5% increase would be 0.025 * $5,000 = $125.
2. For the electronic devices option, a 1.2% increase would be 0.012 * $8,000 = $96.
3. To calculate the profit, we subtract the initial cost from the increased value for each option:
   - Jewelry: $5,000 + $125 = $5,125
   - Electronic devices: $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

If she works 50 weeks per year, 35 hours per week as a teacher and 15 hours as a coach, what is her annual salary? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Jill works 35 hours per week as a teacher, so in a year she works 35 hours/week * 50 weeks = 1750 hours as a teacher.
Jill works 15 hours per week as a coach, so in a year she works 15 hours/week * 50 weeks = 750 hours as a coach.

For coaching, Jill earns $30 per hour, so her total earnings as a coach are 750 hours * $30/hour = $22,500.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The orange drink is two-thirds water, so 2/3 * 10 = 20/3 liters of water in the orange drink.
The pineapple drink is three-quarters water, so 3/4 * 15 = 45/4 liters of water in the pineapple drink.
When pouring, one liter of the orange drink was spilled, so the remaining orange drink is 10 - 1 = 9 liters.
To find the total amount of water in the remaining 24 liters, we need to add the water from the orange drink and the water from the pineapple drink.
The total amount of water is 20/3 + 45/4 = 80/12 + 45/12 = 125/12 liters.

What was the original price of the book? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Let's assume the original price of the book is x dollars. 
Kyle received a 25% discount, which means he paid 75% of the original price. 
So, 75% of x is equal to $19.50. 
To find the original price, we can set up the equation: 
0.75x = $19.50 
Dividing both sides of the equation by 0.75, we get: 
x = $19.50 / 0.75 
x = $26

Step-by-Step Answer:

If their total current age is 162 years, calculate Allen's age 10 years from now.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. The ratio of Darrel's age to Allen's age is 7:11.
2. Let's assume that Darrel's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x.
3. The total current age of Darrel and Allen is 7x + 11x = 18x.
4. We are given that the total current age is 162 years, so 18x = 162.
5. Solving for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 18: x = 162/18 = 9.
6. Now we can find Allen's current age by substituting x = 9 into the equation: Allen's age = 11x = 11 * 9 = 99 years.
7. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109 years.

",Question: Gunter anajaribu kuhesabu peremende zilizo kwenye chupa kubwa. Anawauliza marafiki zake kuwa wanadhani peremende ngapi zipo kwenye chupa hiyo kubwa. Mmoja anasema 80. Mwingine anasema 20 zaidi ya nusu ya ile wa kwanza alisema. Wa tatu anasema 25% zaidi ya wa kwanza. Wastani ya kisio lao ni ngapi?,80,"Translation to English: Question: Gunter is trying to count the candies in a large jar. He asks his friends how many candies they think are in the jar. One says 80. Another says 20 more than half of what the first person said. The third person says 25% more than what the first person said. What is the average of their estimates? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The first person's estimate is 80 candies.
The second person's estimate is 20 more than half of 80, which is 20 + (80/2) = 20 + 40 = 60 candies.
The third person's estimate is 25% more than 80, which is 80 + (0.25 * 80) = 80 + 20 = 100 candies.

To find the average of their estimates, we add up all the estimates and divide by the number of estimates. 
Average = (80 + 60 + 100) / 3 = 240 / 3 = 80.

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume Gretchen has x silver coins. Since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, Gretchen has x + 30 gold coins. 
The total number of coins Gretchen has is x (silver coins) + x + 30 (gold coins) = 110 coins. 
Combining like terms, we get 2x + 30 = 110. 
Subtracting 30 from both sides, we get 2x = 80. 
Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 40. 
So Gretchen has 40 silver coins and 40 + 30 = 70 gold coins.

If she can jump 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends one-third of an hour running and two-thirds of an hour walking?
Step-by-Step Answer: Dana can jump at a speed of 3 miles per hour. This means her running speed is twice as fast, which is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour. If she spends one-third of an hour running, she can cover a distance of 6 * (1/3) = 2 miles. If she spends two-thirds of an hour walking, she can cover a distance of 3 * (2/3) = 2 miles. In total, she can travel 2 + 2 = 4 miles in six hours. The answer is 4.",False

He spent $200 to buy blue ties that are sold for $40 each. How much money did he spend to buy the ties? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The price of blue ties is $40 each. John spent $200 to buy blue ties, so he bought 200/40 = 5 blue ties.
Since he buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.
The price of red ties is 50% more than the price of blue ties, which means the price of red ties is 40 + (40 * 50/100) = $60 each.

After the additional fees, what was Stephen's final price for the groceries?

If the streaming company charged her the same initial amount for the first half of the year and then charged her a reduced rate of 10% for the second half of the year, calculate the total amount she had paid for the streaming service at the end of the year.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The initial amount charged per month is $140.
For the first half of the year, which is 6 months, Aleena paid $140 x 6 = $840.
For the second half of the year, which is also 6 months, Aleena paid 10% less than the initial amount, which is $140 - ($140 x 0.10) = $126 per month.

He eventually realizes that each level of the sandcastle will have half the square feet of the level below it. If he builds a sandcastle with 4 levels and the top level has 16 square feet, what is the average square feet of each level? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The top level has 16 square feet. 
The level below it will have half of that, which is 16/2 = 8 square feet. 
The level below that will have half of 8, which is 8/2 = 4 square feet.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Let's assume that David washes x pounds of clothes.
2. Sarah washes four times the amount of clothes that David washes, so Sarah washes 4x pounds of clothes.
3. Raymond washes half the amount of clothes that Sarah washes, so Raymond washes 1/2 * 4x = 2x pounds of clothes.
4. Sarah washes 400 pounds of clothes, so 4x = 400.
5. Solving for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: x = 400/4 = 100.
6. Therefore, David washes 100 pounds of clothes.
7. Raymond washes 2x = 2 * 100 = 200 pounds of clothes.

",Question: Vincent anaweza kununua maua katika vifurushi vya 3 kwa $2.50 au katika vifurushi 2 vya $1. Huwa anaokoa pesa ngapi kwa kununua maua 18 kwa bei bora?,6,"Translation to English: Question: Vincent can buy flowers in packages of 3 for $2.50 or in packages of 2 for $1. How much money does he save by buying 18 flowers at the better price? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
To find out how much money Vincent saves, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in each package option. 

Option 1: Buying in packages of 3 for $2.50
If Vincent buys 18 flowers in packages of 3, he would need to buy 18/3 = 6 packages.
The cost of 6 packages would be 6 * $2.50 = $15.

Option 2: Buying in packages of 2 for $1
If Vincent buys 18 flowers in packages of 2, he would need to buy 18/2 = 9 packages.
The cost of 9 packages would be 9 * $1 = $9.

To calculate the amount of money Vincent saves, we subtract the cost of Option 2 from the cost of Option 1:
$15 - $9 = $6.

Therefore, Vincent saves $6 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

The answer is $6.",True

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume the number of games they lost is x. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is x + 8. 

The total number of games they played is the sum of the games they won and the games they lost, which is x + (x + 8) = 22. 

Combining like terms, we get 2x + 8 = 22. 

Subtracting 8 from both sides, we get 2x = 14. 

Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 7. 

Therefore, the number of games they won is x + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.

The company has a policy of increasing each employee's salary by 10% of their previous salary every year for those who have been with the company for five years. If Sylvie reached five years in the company last December, what is her annual salary after three more years of service?

Step-by-Step Answer: Sylvie has been with the company for five years, so she is eligible for the salary increase. Her initial salary is $600 per month, which means her annual salary is 12 * $600 = $7200. 

For each year after the fifth year, her salary will increase by 10% of her previous salary. After three more years, her salary will increase by 10% three times. 

First increase: $7200 * 10% = $720

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume Harald sold x copies of his record. Marilyn's record sold 10 times more, so Marilyn sold 10x copies. The total number of copies sold is x + 10x = 11x. We know that the total number of copies sold is 88,000, so 11x = 88,000. Dividing both sides of the equation by 11, we get x = 8,000. Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies. The answer is 8,000.",True

Let's start by finding the number of cats. Since there are two cats for every dog, and the number of dogs is 60, we can calculate the number of cats as 2 * 60 = 120.

Next, we can find the total number of dogs, cats, and rabbits by adding the numbers together. The total number of pets is 60 (dogs) + 120 (cats) + 12 (rabbits) = 192.

Therefore, there are a total of 192 pets in the neighborhood. 
The answer is 192.",False

Finally, he drinks one glass before going to bed. John does this every day of the week, but on weekends he likes to relax and drink soda instead of water during dinner. How many glasses of water does John drink per week? 

Step-by-Step Answer: John drinks a glass of water during breakfast, lunch, and dinner, which is 3 glasses per day. He also drinks one glass before going to bed, so that's a total of 4 glasses per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, John drinks 4 glasses of water per day * 7 days per week = 28 glasses of water per week. However, on weekends he drinks soda instead of water during dinner, so we need to subtract 2 glasses of water from the total. Therefore, John drinks a total of 28 glasses of water per week - 2 glasses of water on the weekend = 26 glasses of water per week.

It takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city. If the city is 42 miles wide from the shoreline to the opposite side of the mainland, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the entire city? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
To find out how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we need to divide the total width of the city by the width covered in 10 minutes.

The city is 42 miles wide.
In 10 minutes, the fog bank covers 3 miles.

To find out how many sets of 3 miles are in 42 miles, we divide 42 by 3:
42 / 3 = 14

So, it will take 14 sets of 10 minutes to cover the entire city:
14 * 10 = 140

Therefore, the fog bank will take 140 minutes to cover the entire city.

","Question: Marcell na Beatrice wana shindano la kuona anayeweza kula zaidi matunda yaliyokunjwa, hivyo wanakunjua kiasi wanachoweza kupata. Kwa bahati mbaya, mtu anafanya kosa kwani matunda ya Beatrice yalikuwa na mikunjo miwili kwa upana na mikunjo 24 kwa urefu huku matunda ya Marcel yalikuwa na mikunjo 3 kwa upana na mikunjo 14 kwa urefu. Iwapo wote wawili walikula matunda hayo yote, walikula ngapi kwa wastani?",45,"Translation to English: Question: Marcell and Beatrice have a competition to see who can eat more folded fruits, so they unfold as much as they can. Unfortunately, someone made a mistake as Beatrice's fruits had 2 folds in width and 24 folds in length while Marcell's fruits had 3 folds in width and 14 folds in length. If they both ate all the fruits, how many folds did they eat on average?

Step-by-Step Answer: To find the total number of folds, we need to add the number of folds in width and length for each person. For Beatrice, the total number of folds is 2 + 24 = 26. For Marcell, the total number of folds is 3 + 14 = 17. 

To find the average number of folds, we need to divide the total number of folds by the number of people, which is 2 in this case. So, the average number of folds eaten by each person is (26 + 17) / 2 = 21.5.

The boat was taking in two liters of water for every ten feet she rowed back to shore. It took her sixteen seconds to row twenty feet. The shore was sixty-four seconds away. How much water had the boat taken in by the time Julia reached the shore? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Julia rows 20 feet in 16 seconds.
2. The boat takes in 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed.
3. To find out how much water the boat took in, we need to calculate the number of 10-feet intervals Julia rowed.

Calculate the number of containers that were purchased from outside the country on the second day, assuming that all containers had 5 cars.

Four years later, his salary had increased, and he was earning 40% more than what he was earning four years ago. If Adrien's and Lulah's salaries increased proportionally, and Adrien was earning $40000 four years ago, calculate the total salary that these two people were receiving four years later.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000.
2. Adrien's salary increased by 40% four years later. So, his salary four years later is $40000 + ($40000 * 40%) = $40000 + $16000 = $56000.
3. The total salary of Adrien and Lulah four years later is the sum of their individual salaries. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lulah's, we can calculate Lulah's salary as follows:
   - Let L be Lulah's salary four years ago.

Wakati Julia alikuwa anaandaa mchuzi, alitumia vijiko vitatu kati ya vijiko vyote kuonja mchuzi wake. Baadaye, alipoenda kuandaa meza, alikuwa na jumla ya vijiko 12. Vijiko vingapi vilikuwa katika kifurushi ambacho Julia alinunua?",10,"Translation to English: Question: Julia was hosting a dinner party at her house, where she planned to serve soup to the guests. She realized that her plastic spoons had run out, so she bought a new pack of spoons. Later, her husband also bought a pack of 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia. While Julia was preparing the soup, she used three spoons out of all the spoons to taste her soup. Later, when she went to set the table, she had a total of 12 spoons. How many spoons were in the pack that Julia bought?

Step-by-Step Answer: Julia initially had a pack of spoons and her husband bought an additional pack of 5 spoons. So, the total number of spoons they had was the sum of the spoons in Julia's pack and the 5 spoons her husband bought. Let's call the number of spoons in Julia's pack ""x"". After using 3 spoons to taste the soup, Julia had 12 spoons left. This means that the number of spoons in the pack was x + 5 - 3 = 12. Simplifying this equation, we get x + 2 = 12.

The total number of miles he walked from Monday to Wednesday was 41 miles. How many miles did he walk on Wednesday?.
Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume the number of miles Walt walked on Tuesday is x. On Monday, he walked 4 miles. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times more miles than Monday, which is 6 * 4 = 24 miles. The total number of miles from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles. So, 4 + 24 + x = 41. Simplifying the equation, we get x = 41 - 4 - 24 = 13. Therefore, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

The number of worker bees is twice as many as the number of baby bees, and the number of baby bees is three times as many as the number of queen bees. How many worker bees are there?

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's start with the number of queen bees. If the number of baby bees is three times as many as the number of queen bees, then the number of queen bees is 700 divided by 3, which is 233.333. Since we can't have a fraction of a bee, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 233.

Next, we'll calculate the number of baby bees. If the number of worker bees is twice as many as the number of baby bees, then the number of baby bees is 233 divided by 2, which is 116.5. Again, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, which is 116.

Finally, we'll calculate the number of worker bees. If the number of worker bees is twice as many as the number of baby bees, then the number of worker bees is 116 multiplied by 2, which is 232.

If Tim can use his skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner wait at home before the loser arrives home? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
To find out how long it takes for each person to get home, we need to calculate the time it takes for them to travel the distance to their homes. 

Steve lives 3 miles away from school and can ride his bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute. To convert miles to feet, we multiply 3 by 5280 (the number of feet in a mile). So, Steve's distance in feet is 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet.

Finally, one person came with a bike that had only one tire. How much money did she make that day?.

Step-by-Step Answer:

- 3 people came with bikes and each had 3 tires, so that's 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
- 1 person came with a bike that had 1 tire.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The price of the marble bag increases by 20% every two months. After 36 months, there are 36/2 = 18 two-month periods.
Each two-month period, the price increases by 20% of the original price. So, the price after one two-month period is 20 + (20% of 20) = 20 + 4 = 24 dollars.
After two two-month periods, the price increases again by 20% of the original price. So, the price after two two-month periods is 24 + (20% of 20) = 24 + 4 = 28 dollars.
We can continue this pattern for the remaining 16 two-month periods.

After 2 years, Brooke's age will be x + 2 and Seth's age will be 2x + 2. The sum of their ages after 2 years will be (x + 2) + (2x + 2) = 3x + 4. According to the question, the sum of their ages after 2 years is 28, so we can write the equation 3x + 4 = 28. Solving this equation, we find that x = 8. Therefore, Seth's age is 2x = 2 * 8 = 16.

Each uniform comes with a hat that costs $25, a jacket that costs three times the price of the hat, and pants that cost the average of the price of the hat and the jacket. How much does each uniform cost in total?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Let's denote the price of the hat as H, the price of the jacket as J, and the price of the pants as P.

We know that J = 3H (the jacket costs three times the price of the hat).

We also know that P = (H + J)/2 (the pants cost the average of the price of the hat and the jacket).

To find the total price of each uniform, we need to add the prices of the hat, jacket, and pants: H + J + P.

Substituting the values of J and P from the given equations, we get:
H + 3H + (H + 3H)/2.

Simplifying the expression, we have:
H + 3H + (2H + 6H)/2 = 6H + 8H/2 = 6H + 4H = 10H.

If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payment, how much does she pay per year?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The minimum payment for student loans is $300 per month. If Jessica wants to pay 50% more, she will pay $300 + ($300 * 0.5) = $300 + $150 = $450 per month for student loans.
The minimum payment for credit card is $200 per month. If Jessica wants to pay 50% more, she will pay $200 + ($200 * 0.5) = $200 + $100 = $300 per month for credit card.

Step-by-Step Answer: It takes Billy 1.5 minutes to peel each potato and 5 seconds to cut it. Since there are 60 potatoes, he will spend a total of 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes peeling the potatoes. He will spend 5 * 60 = 300 seconds cutting the potatoes. To convert the cutting time to minutes, we divide 300 by 60, which gives us 5 minutes.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Let's calculate the cost of making one gallon of lemonade. They spend $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so the total cost is $3 + $2 = $5.
2. They sell each glass for $0.50 and one gallon carries 20 glasses, so the revenue from one gallon is $0.50 * 20 = $10.
3. Profit is calculated by subtracting the cost from the revenue, so the profit from one gallon is $10 - $5 = $5.

What is the highest probability (in percentage) that he will roll a number greater by 3 than rolling two consecutive losing numbers twice in a row?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The die has six sides, so there are six possible outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
To find the probability of rolling a number greater by 3, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6.
The probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6 is 3 out of 6, or 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2.
To find the probability of rolling two consecutive losing numbers twice in a row, we need to calculate the probability of rolling a 1 and then a 1 again, or rolling a 2 and then a 2 again, or rolling a 3 and then a 3 again, and so on.

He ate a sandwich every day this week for lunch and used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich. He had cheese and egg omelettes for breakfast for 3 days that week, and one omelette had one more slice of cheese than his sandwich. He made a large macaroni and cheese meal to last him several dinners that week and used 8 slices of cheese in that meal. How many slices of cheese did he use in total? 

Step-by-Step Answer: Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, so he used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. There are 7 days in a week, so he used 2 * 7 = 14 slices of cheese for the sandwiches. 
For breakfast, he had cheese and egg omelettes for 3 days. One omelette had one more slice of cheese than his sandwich, so he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese for each omelette. Therefore, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for the omelettes. 
For dinner, he made a macaroni and cheese meal and used 8 slices of cheese.

Step-by-Step Answer: Brinley has already completed five exercises and has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. To find the average, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of exercises. The sum of the scores is 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438. Since there are six exercises in total, the average score should be 93. To find the score Brinley needs in the sixth exercise, we can multiply the average by the total number of exercises and subtract the sum of the scores she already has.

Calculate the total price of each cup.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Let's first calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates:
Half a dozen is equal to 6 plates.
The cost of each plate is $6000.
So, the total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6000 = $36000.

Now, let's calculate the price of twenty dozen cups:
Twenty dozen is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 cups.
The total cost of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups is $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

To find the price of each cup, we divide the total cost by the number of cups:
Price of each cup = Total cost of twenty dozen cups / Number of cups
Price of each cup = $34800 / 240
Price of each cup = $145.

","Question: Jerry ana kundi la kuku. Kuku wekundu huzalisha mayai 3 kwa siku, na kuku weupe huzalisha mayai 5 kwa siku. Kila siku Jerry hukusanya mayai 42. Ikiwa ana kuku weupe wawili zaidi ya wekundu, ana kuku wekundu wangapi?",4,"Translation to English: Question: Jerry has a group of chickens. Red chickens lay 3 eggs per day, and white chickens lay 5 eggs per day. Every day Jerry collects 42 eggs. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume Jerry has x red chickens. Since he has two more white chickens than red chickens, he has x + 2 white chickens.

The red chickens lay 3 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs laid by red chickens is 3x.
The white chickens lay 5 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs laid by white chickens is 5(x + 2).

Every day Jerry collects 42 eggs, so we can set up the equation: 3x + 5(x + 2) = 42.

Simplifying the equation: 3x + 5x + 10 = 42.
Combining like terms: 8x + 10 = 42.
Subtracting 10 from both sides: 8x = 32.
Dividing both sides by 8: x = 4.

Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

Four minutes ago, the larger pool had twice the amount of water as the smaller pool. Now, the larger pool has four times the amount of water as the smaller pool. How much water does the smaller pool have now?

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume the amount of water in the smaller pool is x gallons. Four minutes ago, the larger pool had twice the amount of water, so it had 2x gallons. Since both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, the smaller pool would have lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons in four minutes. 

Now, the larger pool has four times the amount of water as the smaller pool, so it has 4x gallons. In the same four minutes, it would have lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons as well. 

Therefore, the smaller pool currently has x - 16 gallons of water.

Yuri scored 10 more than half of Naomi's points and Brianna scored 17 more than Naomi. How many points did Jojo score? 

Step-by-Step Answer:

He has a $5.00 gift card that he uses to pay. How much money does he still owe?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The base sandwich costs $6.50.
Extra meat costs $2.00.
Extra cheese costs $1.00.
Avocado costs $1.00.
2 sauces cost $0.25 each, so $0.25 * 2 = $0.50.
The upgrade with chips and a drink costs $3.00.
The total cost of the sandwich with all the additions is $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $14.00.
Chad uses a $5.00 gift card to pay, so he still owes $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

Her mother can essentially do half of the pieces that Kalinda can do in a minute. How many hours will it take to complete the puzzle? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute. 
Her mother can do half of what Kalinda can do, so her mother can add 4/2 = 2 pieces per minute. 
Together, Kalinda and her mother can add 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute. 
To find the total time it will take to complete the puzzle, we divide the total number of pieces (360) by the number of pieces they can add per minute (6). 
360 / 6 = 60 minutes.

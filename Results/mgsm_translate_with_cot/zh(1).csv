Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. The value of the house increased by 150%, which means it became 100% + 150% = 250% of its original value.
2. To find the new value of the house, we need to calculate 250% of $80,000.
   250% of $80,000 = (250/100) * $80,000 = $200,000.
3. The total cost of purchasing the house and renovations is $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.
4. To calculate the profit, we subtract the total cost from the new value of the house.

He tried to get back home in 4 hours, but the first 2 hours were spent in heavy traffic. In the next half hour, he drove at a speed of 30 miles per hour, and then for the remaining 4 hours, he could drive at a speed of 80 miles per hour. How far is he from home after 4 hours?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
- John drove at a speed of 60 miles per hour for 3 hours, so he covered a distance of 60 * 3 = 180 miles.
- He then turned around and drove back, so he covered another 180 miles.
- In the first 2 hours of his return journey, he was stuck in traffic and didn't cover any distance.
- In the next half hour, he drove at a speed of 30 miles per hour, so he covered a distance of 30 * 0.5 = 15 miles.
- For the remaining 4 hours, he drove at a speed of 80 miles per hour, so he covered a distance of 80 * 4 = 320 miles.
- Adding up all the distances, he covered a total distance of 180 + 180 + 15 + 320 = 695 miles.
- Therefore, he is 695 miles away from home after 4 hours.

The number of downloads in the second month is three times the number of downloads in the first month, but the number of downloads in the third month decreased by 30%. How many times was this program downloaded in total over the three months? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
In the first month, the program was downloaded 60 times.
In the second month, the number of downloads is three times the number of downloads in the first month, which is 3 * 60 = 180 times.
In the third month, the number of downloads decreased by 30%, which means there were 30% fewer downloads. 
30% of 180 is 0.3 * 180 = 54.
So, the number of downloads in the third month is 180 - 54 = 126 times.

She sold one-third of the vacuum cleaners in the green house, sold 2 more in the red house, and sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners in the orange house. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, how many vacuum cleaners did she have initially?

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume Melanie initially had x vacuum cleaners.
She sold one-third of the vacuum cleaners in the green house, which is (1/3)x.
In the red house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners, so she sold a total of (1/3)x + 2 vacuum cleaners.
In the orange house, she sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners, which is (1/2)[x - ((1/3)x + 2)] = (1/2)(2/3)x = (1/3)x.
So, the total number of vacuum cleaners sold is (1/3)x + (1/3)x + 2 = (2/3)x + 2.
If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, then the total number of vacuum cleaners she had initially is (2/3)x + 2 + 5 = (2/3)x + 7.
Since this is equal to x, we can set up the equation (2/3)x + 7 = x and solve for x.
Multiplying both sides by 3, we get 2x + 21 = 3x.
Subtracting 2x from both sides, we get 21 = x.
Therefore, Melanie initially had 21 vacuum cleaners.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The chicken rice costs $12.
The 5 boxes of milk cost 5 * $3 = $15.
The 4 apples cost 4 * $1.50 = $6.
The total cost of the chicken rice, milk, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.
Marie paid a total of $50, so the cost of the pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.
Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so Marie ordered $17 / $8.50 = 2 boxes of pizza.

If one pair of high heels is $33 and the price of the other pair of high heels is twice that price, what is the price of the boots?

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's first find the price of the other pair of high heels. If one pair is $33, then the other pair is 2 * $33 = $66. 

Now, we know that the total price of the boots and the two pairs of high heels is $5 more than the price of the high heels. Let's represent the price of the boots as x. 

So, x + $33 + $66 = x + $99 is $5 more than x + $99.

He has 13 sets of Lego, and each set sells for $15. He ends up buying 8 video games, each costing $20, and he has $5 left. How many sets of Lego does he have left? 

Step-by-Step Answer: John sells 13 sets of Lego for $15 each, so he earns a total of 13 * $15 = $195. He then spends $20 per video game for 8 games, which is a total of 8 * $20 = $160. After buying the video games, he has $195 - $160 = $35 left. Since he also has $5 left, the total amount he has left is $35 + $5 = $40. 

To find out how many sets of Lego he has left, we need to divide the remaining amount by the price per set. So, $40 / $15 = 2.67. Since we can't have a fraction of a set, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, John has 2 sets of Lego left.

On the second and third days, he runs for half of the time on the first day, which is 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours or 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes each day.
So, the total running time for the second and third days is 90 + 90 = 180 minutes.

If she can jump 3 miles per hour, then in 6 hours, she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. How far did she travel in total?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Dana spends one-third of the time running, which is 6 * (1/3) = 2 hours.
Dana spends two-thirds of the time walking, which is 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours.

Dana's running speed is four times her walking speed, so her walking speed is 3 miles per hour / 4 = 0.75 miles per hour.
In 2 hours of running, Dana travels 2 hours * 3 miles per hour = 6 miles.

But when Polly holds a blue gem, she can throw the golden spear three times farther than when she doesn't hold the gem. If Polly wants to hit the dragon with the golden spear while holding the gem, how far away can she stand from the dragon's fire range?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Without the blue gem, Polly can throw the golden spear 400 feet, which is within the dragon's fire range.
2. With the blue gem, Polly can throw the golden spear three times farther than without the gem. So, she can throw the golden spear 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.
3. To hit the dragon while standing outside the dragon's fire range, Polly needs to be at least 1000 + 1 feet away from the dragon.
4. Therefore, Polly can stand 1000 + 1 - 1200 = -199 feet away from the dragon's fire range.

If a bag of potato chips weighs 300 grams and contains 5 servings of chips, and your daily calorie goal is 2,000 and you have already consumed 1,800 calories, how many grams of potato chips can you still eat?

Step-by-Step Answer: Each serving of potato chips contains 250 calories, so the total calories in the bag of potato chips is 250 * 5 = 1250 calories. Your daily calorie goal is 2,000 and you have already consumed 1,800 calories, so you have 2,000 - 1,800 = 200 calories left. 

To find out how many grams of potato chips you can still eat, we need to calculate the calories per gram. Since the bag of potato chips weighs 300 grams and contains 1250 calories, the calories per gram is 1250 / 300 = 4.17 calories per gram. 

To find out how many grams of potato chips you can still eat, divide the remaining calories (200) by the calories per gram (4.17): 200 / 4.17 = 47.94 grams. 

Therefore, you can still eat approximately 47.94 grams of potato chips.

The price of red ties is 50% higher than the price of blue ties. He spent $200 on each blue tie that costs $40. How much money did he spend on ties? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Let's assume that John bought x blue ties. Since he bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 2x red ties. 

The price of each blue tie is $40, so the total cost of the blue ties is 40x. 

The price of each red tie is 50% higher than the price of the blue tie, which means it is 1.5 times the price of the blue tie. So the price of each red tie is 1.5 * $40 = $60. 

The total cost of the red ties is 60 * 2x = $120x. 

Therefore, the total cost of all the ties is 40x + 120x = $160x. 

Since John spent $200 on each blue tie, we can set up the equation 200x = 160x and solve for x. 

200x - 160x = 0 
40x = 0 
x = 0 

Since x = 0, it means that John did not buy any blue ties. 

Therefore, the total amount of money John spent on ties is $0.

Step-by-Step Answer: Tom sails for a total of 3 hours (from 1 pm to 4 pm). During this time, he travels at a speed of 10 miles per hour. So, the distance he travels away from his starting point is 3 hours * 10 miles per hour = 30 miles.

Starting from 20 years later, she is entitled to receive 5% of the value of the pension each year. If she resigns after 30 years, what will be her annual retirement pension at that time? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Macy will receive an annual pension of $50,000 for 40 years.
2. Starting from 20 years later, she is entitled to receive 5% of the value of the pension each year.

Let's start with the number of diamonds, which is given as 175.
The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds, so it would be 175 - 35 = 140 rubies.
The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, so it would be 140 * 2 = 280 emeralds.

He noticed that the area of each layer of the sandcastle is half of the area of the layer below it. If he builds a 4-layer sandcastle and the area of the top layer is 16, what is the average area of each layer?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Let's start with the top layer, which has an area of 16. According to the given information, the area of each layer is half of the area of the layer below it. So, the area of the third layer would be 2 times the area of the top layer, which is 2 * 16 = 32. Similarly, the area of the second layer would be 2 times the area of the third layer, which is 2 * 32 = 64. Finally, the area of the first (bottom) layer would be 2 times the area of the second layer, which is 2 * 64 = 128.

To find the average area of each layer, we need to divide the total area of all the layers (16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240) by the number of layers (4). Therefore, the average area of each layer is 240 / 4 = 60.

If one bag of dog food has 110 cups of dog food, how many bags of dog food will Cecilia use up in the first year?.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
In the first 180 days, Cecilia needs to feed the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day. So, in total, she will use 1 cup * 180 days = 180 cups of dog food in the first 180 days.
After the first 180 days, Cecilia needs to feed the puppy 2 cups of dog food every day. There are 365 days in a year, so she will use 2 cups * (365 - 180) days = 370 cups of dog food for the rest of the year.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
To find out how much money Vincent can save, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers at the regular price and the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price. 

If Vincent buys 18 bouquets of 3 flowers each at the regular price, he would need to buy 18/3 = 6 bouquets. 
The cost of buying 6 bouquets at $2.50 each would be 6 * $2.50 = $15. 

If Vincent buys 18 bouquets of 2 flowers each at the better price, he would need to buy 18/2 = 9 bouquets. 
The cost of buying 9 bouquets at $1 each would be 9 * $1 = $9. 

Therefore, Vincent can save $15 - $9 = $6 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.

The total number of matches they participated in is 22. So, the equation would be: 

x + (x - 8) = 22 

Simplifying the equation: 

2x - 8 = 22

The company has a policy that for employees who have worked for the company for 5 years, their salary can be increased by 10% of the initial salary each year. If Sylvia has just completed 5 years of work at this company in December of last year, what will her annual salary be after working for three more years? 

Step-by-Step Answer: Sylvia's initial salary is $600 per month, which means her initial annual salary is 12 * $600 = $7200. According to the company's policy, her salary will increase by 10% of the initial salary each year. After working for 5 years, her salary will be increased by 5 * 10% * $7200 = $3600. 

After working for 5 years, her annual salary will be $7200 + $3600 = $10800.

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume that Harold sold x albums. According to the information given, Marilyn's album sold 10 times as many copies as Harold's, so Marilyn sold 10x albums. The total number of albums sold is the sum of Marilyn's and Harold's sales, which is 10x + x = 11x. We know that the total number of albums sold is 88,000, so we can set up the equation 11x = 88,000.

The total number of pets is the sum of the number of rabbits, cats, and dogs, which is x + 2x + 60.
The number of rabbits is 12 less than the total number of cats and dogs, so it is (x + 2x + 60) - 12.

Combining the two equations, we have:
x + 2x + 60 = (x + 2x + 60) - 12

Simplifying the equation:
3x + 60 = 3x + 48

Subtracting 3x from both sides:
60 = 48

This equation is not possible, which means there is no solution.

Therefore, there is no answer to this question.",False,245,241,False

Some cars passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, and then another 20 cars passed through in the remaining 15 minutes of the traffic jam. 5 cars in the queue exited the highway, so they didn't need to pass through the traffic jam. If there were originally 30 cars on the highway, how many cars passed through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
There were originally 30 cars on the highway. 
Out of these, 5 cars exited the highway, so they didn't pass through the traffic jam. 
Therefore, the number of cars that passed through the traffic jam is 30 - 5 = 25. 
However, we know that some cars passed through in the first 15 minutes and some passed through in the remaining 15 minutes. 
Since we are asked about the number of cars that passed through in the first 15 minutes, we need to subtract the cars that passed through in the remaining 15 minutes. 
So, the number of cars that passed through in the first 15 minutes is 25 - 20 = 5.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The volume of each box can be calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height. 
The volume of each box is 5 inches * 6 inches * 4 inches = 120 cubic inches. 
However, we need to take into account the thickness of the box walls. 
The thickness of the box walls is 1 inch on each side, so we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension. 
The adjusted dimensions of each box are 3 inches by 4 inches by 2 inches. 
The adjusted volume of each box is 3 inches * 4 inches * 2 inches = 24 cubic inches. 
To find the total volume of all 3 boxes, we multiply the adjusted volume of each box by the number of boxes. 
The total volume of all 3 boxes is 24 cubic inches * 3 = 72 cubic inches.

On Monday and Tuesday, he watches one episode of his favorite show, which is 1 hour long. On Wednesday, he watches several episodes of a show that is 30 minutes long per episode. On Thursday, he finishes his homework early and watches one episode that is 1 hour long and one episode that is 30 minutes long. On Friday, because it's the weekend, he stays up late and watches 2 episodes that are 1 hour long each. If he watches a total of 7 hours of TV, how many episodes of the 30-minute show did he watch on Wednesday?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
On Monday and Tuesday, Frankie watches 1 episode each night, so that's a total of 1 + 1 = 2 hours.
On Thursday, he watches 1 episode that is 1 hour long and 1 episode that is 30 minutes long, so that's a total of 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 hours.
On Friday, he watches 2 episodes that are 1 hour long each, so that's a total of 2 * 1 = 2 hours.

So far, Frankie has watched 2 + 1.5 + 2 = 5.5 hours of TV.

If he watches a total of 7 hours of TV, then on Wednesday he must have watched 7 - 5.5 = 1.5 hours of TV.

Since each episode of the 30-minute show is 0.5 hours long, Frankie must have watched 1.5 / 0.5 = 3 episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.

While he was taking the cookies out to cool, he dropped 5 cookies. Now he has a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry make last year?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Let's assume that Henry made x cookies last year.
Henry wanted to make twice as many cookies as last year, so he intended to make 2x cookies this year.
But he actually made 15 more cookies than he intended, so he made 2x + 15 cookies this year.
While taking the cookies out to cool, he dropped 5 cookies, so he has 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 cookies left.
We know that he has a total of 110 cookies left, so we can set up the equation 2x + 10 = 110.
Solving this equation, we find that 2x = 100, which means x = 50.
Therefore, Henry made 50 cookies last year.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times the number of photos that Brittany's phone can hold.
2. Let's say Brittany's phone can hold x photos. Then, Jamal's phone can hold 6x photos.
3. The maximum number of photos that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times the number of ducks in the photos Jamal took at the zoo.

She also has 5 pieces of 4 x 4 x 10 boards, and she bought each board for $16. If she sells everything, how much profit will she make?.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Sasha has 10 pieces of 2 x 4 x 10 boards, and each board cost her $10. So the total cost for these boards is 10 * $10 = $100.
Sasha also has 5 pieces of 4 x 4 x 10 boards, and she bought each board for $16. So the total cost for these boards is 5 * $16 = $80.
The total cost for all the boards is $100 + $80 = $180.
Since the wood price has increased by 50%, Sasha can sell the boards for 1.5 times the cost price.
So the selling price for all the boards is 1.5 * $180 = $270.
The profit Sasha will make is the selling price minus the cost price, which is $270 - $180 = $90.

3. According to the ratio, the amount of water she uses is (13/7) * x cups.
4. The total amount of sugar and water she uses is x + (13/7) * x = (20/7) * x.
5. We know that the total amount of sugar and water is 120 teaspoons and cups, so (20/7) * x = 120.

The price of an orange is $5 less than the price of a watermelon, so it is (3x - 5) dollars. 
Dylan is buying 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. 
The total cost of the watermelons is 4 * (3x) = 12x dollars. 
The total cost of the peppers is 20 * x = 20x dollars. 
The total cost of the oranges is 10 * (3x - 5) = 30x - 50 dollars. 
Adding up the costs of all the items, Dylan will spend 12x + 20x + 30x - 50 dollars in total. 

If each pepper costs $15, we can substitute x with 15 in the equation. 
Therefore, Dylan will spend 12 * 15 + 20 * 15 + 30 * 15 - 50 dollars in total. 
Simplifying the equation, Dylan will spend 180 + 300 + 450 - 50 dollars in total. 
Calculating the sum, Dylan will spend 880 dollars in total. 

The answer is 880.",True,390,381,False

On Tuesday, his walking distance was 6 times his walking distance on Monday. From Monday to Wednesday, his total mileage is 41 miles. How many miles did he walk on Wednesday in total?.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Let's assume the walking distance on Tuesday is x miles.
On Monday, Walter walked 4 miles.
On Tuesday, his walking distance was 6 times his walking distance on Monday, so it was 6 * 4 = 24 miles.
From Monday to Wednesday, his total mileage is 41 miles, so we have the equation: 4 + 24 + x = 41.
Simplifying the equation, we get: 28 + x = 41.
Subtracting 28 from both sides, we get: x = 13.

He already has 3 clients, but is in talks with 5 potential clients and is confident enough to include them in his calculations. Cleaning each client's house will require 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cleaning cloths. Each bottle of bleach costs $2 and each pack of cleaning cloths costs $5. These are his only expenses. Based on his calculations, his total weekly income will reach $92. Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses, so how much profit will Kim make each week?.

Step-by-Step Answer: To calculate the profit, we need to subtract the total expenses from the total income. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cleaning cloths, so the total cost for each client is 2 * $2 + $5 = $9. Kim already has 3 clients, so the total expenses for the existing clients is 3 * $9 = $27. He is also in talks with 5 potential clients, so the total expenses for the potential clients would be 5 * $9 = $45. Therefore, the total expenses would be $27 + $45 = $72.

Then, every bee that left and has not returned before this point returns to the hive in the next 6 hours. How many bees does Deborah see returning to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
In the first 6 hours, Deborah sees 30 bees leaving the hive.
In the next 6 hours, she sees half of that number of bees returning to the hive, which is 30/2 = 15 bees.
In the following 6 hours, she sees twice the number of bees she initially saw leaving the hive flying out and leaving, which is 30 * 2 = 60 bees.
So far, the total number of bees that have returned to the hive is 15 + 60 = 75 bees.

Steve lives farther away than Tim, so he is allowed to ride a bike. Steve's house is 3 miles away from school, and he rides his bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute. Tim's house is 2 miles away from school. If Tim can ride his skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner wait at their own house before the loser finishes the race? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
To find out how long the winner will wait at their own house, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to reach their house. 

Steve's house is 3 miles away, and he rides his bike at a speed of 440 feet per minute. To convert miles to feet, we multiply 3 by 5280 (the number of feet in a mile), so Steve's house is 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet away. The time it takes for Steve to reach his house is 15840 / 440 = 36 minutes. 

Tim's house is 2 miles away, and he rides his skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute. To convert miles to feet, we multiply 2 by 5280, so Tim's house is 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet away. The time it takes for Tim to reach his house is 10560 / 264 = 40 minutes.

Before a hungry seagull stole the bag of fries from his hand, he ate 14 fries. When the seagull landed, it greedily ate half of the amount of fries that Dave had eaten. Then 3 pigeons chased it away and each pigeon ate 3 fries. Later, a raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. An ant carried away the last fry, leaving behind 5 fries. How many fries were in the bag when Dave bought it? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Dave ate 14 fries before the seagull stole the bag.
2. The seagull ate half of the amount of fries that Dave had eaten, which is 14/2 = 7 fries.
3. After the seagull ate, there were 14 - 7 = 7 fries left.
4. The pigeons each ate 3 fries, so in total they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
5. After the pigeons ate, there were 7 - 9 = -2 fries left. (Negative number means there are no fries left)
6. The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, which is (2/3) * 7 = 4.67 fries (rounded to the nearest whole number).
7. After the raccoon stole, there were -2 - 5 = -7 fries left.
8. The ant carried away the last fry, so there were -7 - 1 = -8 fries left.

Each bread roll is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is 2 feet long. If Bill connects all the finished breads end to end, how many feet long is it in total?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
To find the total length, we need to calculate the length of each type of bread and then add them together.

The length of the bread rolls is 300 * 4 inches = 1200 inches.
The length of the croissants is 120 * 6 inches = 720 inches.
The length of the baguettes is 60 * 2 feet = 120 feet.

To convert inches to feet, we divide the total inches by 12.
So, the length of the bread rolls in feet is 1200 inches / 12 = 100 feet.
The length of the croissants in feet is 720 inches / 12 = 60 feet.

Now, we can add up the lengths of all the breads:
100 feet (bread rolls) + 60 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 280 feet.

",如果一袋大理石 20 美元，而且价格每两个月比原价上涨 20%。在 36 个月后，一袋大理石多少钱？,92,"Translation to English: If a bag of marbles is $20, and the price increases by 20% every two months. How much does a bag of marbles cost after 36 months?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The price of the bag of marbles increases by 20% every two months. After 36 months, there are 36/2 = 18 two-month periods.
For each two-month period, the price increases by 20%. So, the price after 18 two-month periods is 20 * (1 + 0.2)^18.
Calculating this, we get 20 * (1.2)^18 = 20 * 6.1917364224 = 123.834728448.
Therefore, after 36 months, a bag of marbles costs $123.83.

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume Brooke's age is x. According to the given information, Seth's age is twice that of Brooke's, so Seth's age is 2x. 

In two years, Brooke's age will be x + 2 and Seth's age will be 2x + 2. The sum of their ages in two years will be (x + 2) + (2x + 2) = 3x + 4. 

According to the problem, the sum of their ages in two years will be 28, so we can set up the equation 3x + 4 = 28. 

Solving this equation, we subtract 4 from both sides to get 3x = 24, and then divide both sides by 3 to get x = 8. 

Therefore, Seth is currently 2x = 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

How much does each uniform cost in total?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Let's start by finding the price of the jacket. Since the price of the jacket is three times the price of the hat, the jacket costs 3 * $25 = $75.

Next, let's find the average price of the hat and the jacket. The average price is ( $25 + $75 ) / 2 = $50.

Finally, let's find the price of the pants. The price of the pants is the average price of the hat and the jacket, which is $50.

Therefore, the total cost of each uniform is $25 (hat) + $75 (jacket) + $50 (pants) = $150.

The minimum monthly payment for her student loan is $300, for her credit card is $200, and for her mortgage is $500. If Jessica wants to repay 50% more than the minimum payment, how much will she repay in total in a year?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The minimum monthly payment for the student loan is $300.
The minimum monthly payment for the credit card is $200.
The minimum monthly payment for the mortgage is $500.

To repay 50% more than the minimum payment, Jessica will pay an additional 50% of each minimum payment.

50% of $300 is $150.
50% of $200 is $100.
50% of $500 is $250.

So, Jessica will pay an additional $150 for her student loan, $100 for her credit card, and $250 for her mortgage each month.

To calculate the total amount Jessica will repay in a year, we need to multiply the additional monthly payment by 12 (months in a year).

$150 * 12 = $1800 (additional payment for the student loan in a year)
$100 * 12 = $1200 (additional payment for the credit card in a year)
$250 * 12 = $3000 (additional payment for the mortgage in a year)

Adding up all the additional payments, Jessica will repay a total of $1800 + $1200 + $3000 = $6000 in a year.

It's a big event, so he needs to prepare 60 potatoes. The potatoes are all about the same size, and it takes about the same amount of time to peel and cut each potato. It takes Billy about a minute and a half to peel one potato, but only about 5 seconds to cut one potato. How long will it take Billy to prepare all these potatoes?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
To peel one potato, it takes Billy about 1.5 minutes.
To cut one potato, it takes Billy about 5 seconds.
Billy needs to prepare 60 potatoes.
To calculate the total time, we need to convert the time to the same unit.
1.5 minutes is equal to 90 seconds (1.5 * 60).
So, for peeling 60 potatoes, it will take Billy 90 seconds * 60 potatoes = 5400 seconds.
For cutting 60 potatoes, it will take Billy 5 seconds * 60 potatoes = 300 seconds.
To find the total time, we add the time for peeling and cutting: 5400 seconds + 300 seconds = 5700 seconds.
Therefore, it will take Billy 5700 seconds to prepare all these potatoes.

They need $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar to make one gallon of lemonade. They can make 20 cups per gallon and sell each cup for $0.50. If their profit is $25, how much money did they spend on buying lemons?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
To make one gallon of lemonade, they need $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so the total cost for one gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.
They can make 20 cups per gallon, so the cost per cup is $5 / 20 = $0.25.
If they sell each cup for $0.50, their profit per cup is $0.50 - $0.25 = $0.25.
If their profit is $25, the number of cups they sold is $25 / $0.25 = 100 cups.
Since they can make 20 cups per gallon, the number of gallons they made is 100 cups / 20 cups per gallon = 5 gallons.
To make 5 gallons of lemonade, they spent $5 per gallon, so the total amount of money they spent on buying lemons is 5 gallons * $3 per gallon = $15.

In this race, each team has 4 members, and each member runs 400 meters or one lap around the standard track. In these two teams, one team is very organized, with each member running the 400-meter segment in exactly 55 seconds. The other team is less organized, with the first runner taking 60 seconds to complete the 400-meter segment, and each subsequent runner being 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. Based on this information, how many seconds did the faster team win by?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The first team runs the 400-meter segment in 55 seconds per member.
The second team's first runner runs the 400-meter segment in 60 seconds.
The second team's second runner runs the 400-meter segment in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The second team's third runner runs the 400-meter segment in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The second team's fourth runner runs the 400-meter segment in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

To find out how many seconds the faster team won by, we need to calculate the total time for each team.
The total time for the first team is 55 * 4 = 220 seconds.
The total time for the second team is 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6, or 1/2, which is 50%.
The probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers can be calculated by considering the possible outcomes:
- The first roll can be 2, 4, or 6, which is a 3/6 or 1/2 probability.
- If the first roll is 2, the second roll must be 4, which is a 1/6 probability.
- If the first roll is 4, the second roll must be 2 or 6, which is a 2/6 or 1/3 probability.
- If the first roll is 6, the second roll must be 2, which is a 1/6 probability.
To find the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers, we multiply the probabilities of each event: (1/2) * (1/6) = 1/12, which is approximately 0.0833 or 8.33%.
The difference in probability between rolling a number greater than 3 and rolling two consecutive even numbers is 50% - 8.33% = 41.67%.
Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is greater than the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers by approximately 41.67%.

The mice are kept in 3 cages with the same number of mice in each cage, and each mouse receives 6 straws. The hamsters are kept in 10 cages individually, and each hamster receives 5 straws. In addition, there is one cage for rabbits, and they receive 20 straws. No straw is used anywhere else in the pet store. If 160 straws are distributed to the small rodents, how many mice are there in each cage? 

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume there are x mice in each cage. Since there are 3 cages, the total number of mice is 3x. Each mouse receives 6 straws, so the total number of straws for the mice is 6 * 3x = 18x. 

There are 10 cages for hamsters, and each hamster receives 5 straws. So the total number of straws for the hamsters is 5 * 10 = 50. 

There is one cage for rabbits, and they receive 20 straws. 

In total, the number of straws distributed is 18x + 50 + 20 = 160. 

Simplifying the equation, we have 18x + 70 = 160. 

Subtracting 70 from both sides, we have 18x = 90.

",曼蒂欠本尼迪克特 100 美元。他们约好月利率为 2%。如果曼蒂能在 3 个月后还清欠款，她需要付给本尼迪克特多少钱？,106,"Translation to English: Question: Mandy owes Benedict $100. They agreed on a monthly interest rate of 2%. If Mandy can repay the debt in 3 months, how much money does she need to pay Benedict? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
First, we need to calculate the interest for each month. 
The interest for the first month is 2% of $100, which is 0.02 * $100 = $2. 
The interest for the second month is also $2. 
The interest for the third month is again $2. 

So, the total interest for 3 months is $2 + $2 + $2 = $6. 

In addition to the interest, Mandy also needs to repay the original debt of $100. 

Therefore, Mandy needs to pay Benedict $6 (interest) + $100 (original debt) = $106 in total.

It costs $2 to transport each bag of wheat from the farm to the warehouse. After selling all the wheat at a price of $30 per bag, the businessman made a total profit of $400. How many bags did he sell?

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume the businessman bought x bags of wheat from the farmer. The cost of buying the wheat would be 20x dollars. The cost of transporting each bag to the warehouse is $2, so the total cost of transportation would be 2x dollars.

The total cost for the businessman would be the cost of buying the wheat plus the cost of transportation, which is 20x + 2x = 22x dollars.

The businessman sold all the wheat at a price of $30 per bag, so the total revenue from selling the wheat would be 30x dollars.

The profit for the businessman would be the revenue from selling the wheat minus the total cost, which is 30x - 22x = 8x dollars.

We know that the businessman made a total profit of $400, so we can set up the equation 8x = 400.

Solving for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 8: x = 400/8 = 50.

Therefore, the businessman sold 50 bags of wheat.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The cost of the tickets is $20.25, so each ticket costs $20.25 / 3 = $6.75.
They spent $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets on food, so the total cost of the food is $6.75 - $4.50 = $2.25.
They played 2 different amusement rides, each costing $33, so the total cost of the rides is $33 * 2 = $66.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
To find out how many pounds of insects the group of 10 ducks need per day, we first need to calculate how many pounds of insects they need per week. 
Since each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week, the total amount needed for the group of 10 ducks is 3.5 * 10 = 35 pounds per week. 
To find out the daily amount, we divide the weekly amount by 7 (the number of days in a week). So, 35 / 7 = 5 pounds per day.

If Blinley scored 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 in the first five exams, how many points does he need to score in the sixth exam to achieve an average score of 93?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Blinley has taken 5 exams and scored 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86.
2. To find the average score, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of exams.

3. The average score of the first five exams is 87.6.
4. Blinley wants to achieve an average score of 93.
5. To find the score he needs in the sixth exam, we can multiply the desired average by the total number of exams and subtract the sum of the scores from the first five exams.
   (93 * 6) - (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) = 558 - 438 = 120

The red chickens lay 3 eggs each day, and the white chickens lay 5 eggs each day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?.

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume the number of red chickens is R and the number of white chickens is W. 
The red chickens lay 3 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs laid by red chickens is 3R.
The white chickens lay 5 eggs each day, so the total number of eggs laid by white chickens is 5W.
Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, so we have the equation 3R + 5W = 42.
We also know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, so we have the equation W = R + 2.

Substituting the value of W from the second equation into the first equation, we get 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42.
Simplifying the equation, we get 3R + 5R + 10 = 42.
Combining like terms, we get 8R + 10 = 42.
Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 8R = 32.
Dividing both sides by 8, we get R = 4.

The distance he walks is the perimeter of the rectangular park, which is 2 times the sum of the length and width. In this case, the length is 1.5 miles and the width is 6 miles. So the distance he walks is 2 * (1.5 + 6) = 15 miles.

Now, the water level in the big pool is four times that of the small pool. How much water is currently in the small pool?

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume the current water level in the small pool is x gallons. 4 minutes ago, the water level in the big pool was twice that of the small pool, so it was 2x gallons. In the past 4 minutes, both pools have been emptied at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, so the small pool has lost 4*4 = 16 gallons of water.

Currently, the water level in the big pool is four times that of the small pool, so it is 4x gallons. Since both pools have been emptied at the same rate, the big pool has also lost 16 gallons of water.

To find the current water level in the small pool, we can set up the equation: x - 16 = 4x. Solving this equation, we get 3x = 16, which means x = 16/3.

Therefore, the current water level in the small pool is 16/3 gallons.

Step-by-Step Answer: Janice borrowed $2,000 and promised to pay back an additional 10% of that amount, which is $200. So in total, she needs to pay back $2,000 + $200 = $2,200. 

If she plans to pay $165 per month for 12 months, the total amount she will pay is $165 * 12 = $1,980. 

To find the remaining debt, we subtract the total amount she will pay from the total amount she needs to pay back: $2,200 - $1,980 = $220.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The base burrito costs $6.50.
He added $2.00 for meat, $1.00 for cheese, $1.00 for avocado, and 2 servings of sauce for $0.25 each. 
So the total cost of the burrito with all the extras is $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + (2 * $0.25) = $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00.
He decided to spend an additional $3.00 to upgrade his meal with fries and a drink.
So the total cost of his meal after the upgrade is $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.
He has a gift card worth $5.00 that he can use at checkout.
So the amount he still needs to pay is $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.

The auditorium has 3 entrances, A, B, and C, which also serve as exits. After a meeting, 30% of the students exited through entrance A, and the remaining 3/5 exited through entrance B. Calculate the number of students who exited through entrance C.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. The total number of students in the auditorium is 1,000.
2. 30% of the students exited through entrance A. This means 30% of 1,000, which is 0.3 * 1,000 = 300 students, exited through entrance A.
3. The remaining students are those who did not exit through entrance A. This means there are 1,000 - 300 = 700 students remaining.
4. 3/5 of the remaining students exited through entrance B. This means 3/5 of 700, which is (3/5) * 700 = 420 students, exited through entrance B.
5. The remaining students are those who did not exit through entrance A or B. This means there are 700 - 420 = 280 students remaining.
6. The number of students who exited through entrance C is equal to the number of students remaining, which is 280 students.

Step-by-Step Answer: Mike originally had 5 pen pals, but he is no longer pen pals with 2 of them. That means he is currently pen pals with 5 - 2 = 3 people. Each person sends 2 letters that are 5 pages long, so in total, Mike receives 3 * 2 = 6 letters every week. 

Mike responds to each letter in the same way, so he also sends 6 letters every week. It takes him 6 minutes to write one page, so it takes him 6 * 5 = 30 minutes to write one letter.

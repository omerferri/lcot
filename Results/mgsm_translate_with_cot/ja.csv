She sold one-third of the vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 at the red house, and half of the remaining ones at the orange house. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, how many did she have at the beginning of the sales?

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume Melanie had x vacuum cleaners at the beginning. 
She sold one-third of the vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is (1/3)x.
She sold 2 vacuum cleaners at the red house.
She sold half of the remaining ones at the orange house, which is (1/2)(x - (1/3)x - 2).
So, the equation becomes: x - (1/3)x - 2 - (1/2)(x - (1/3)x - 2) = 5.
Simplifying the equation: x - (1/3)x - 2 - (1/2)x + (1/6)x + 1 = 5.

",Question: カイルは去年、ベストセラーの本を$19.50で購入しました。元の価格よりも25%安値です。この本の元の価格はいくらですか？,26,"Translation to English: Question: Kyle bought a best-selling book last year for $19.50. It was 25% cheaper than the original price. What was the original price of the book?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Let's assume the original price of the book is x dollars.
According to the information given, the book was 25% cheaper than the original price, which means Kyle bought it for 100% - 25% = 75% of the original price.
We can express this as an equation: 75% of x = $19.50.
To find the original price, we need to solve for x.
We can rewrite 75% as a decimal by dividing it by 100: 0.75.
So the equation becomes: 0.75x = $19.50.
To isolate x, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75: x = $19.50 / 0.75.
Evaluating the right side of the equation gives us: x = $26.
Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume the price of the boots is x dollars. The total price of the two pairs of high heels is (33 + 2*33) = 99 dollars. According to the given information, the total price of the high heels is $5 cheaper than the boots. So, we can set up the equation: 99 = x - 5. Solving this equation, we find that x = 104.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Let's assume that Daryl's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x, where x is a common factor.
2. According to the given information, 7x + 11x = 162.
3. Combining like terms, we get 18x = 162.
4. Dividing both sides of the equation by 18, we get x = 9.
5. Now, we can find Allen's current age by substituting x = 9 into the equation. Allen's age is 11x = 11 * 9 = 99.
6. To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age. 99 + 10 = 109.

Step-by-Step Answer: John has 10 dogs and he spends 30 minutes taking care of each dog every day. To find out how many hours he spends in a week, we need to multiply the number of dogs by the time spent per dog and then multiply that by the number of days in a week. 

10 dogs * 30 minutes per dog = 300 minutes per day

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume Gretchen has x gold coins. Since she has 30 more gold coins than silver coins, she must have x - 30 silver coins. 

The total number of coins Gretchen has is the sum of her gold and silver coins, which is x + (x - 30). 

According to the question, she has a total of 110 coins. So we can write the equation as x + (x - 30) = 110. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 2x - 30 = 110. 

Adding 30 to both sides of the equation, we get 2x = 140. 

Dividing both sides of the equation by 2, we get x = 70.

1. John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, so the ratio of red ties to blue ties is 2:1.
2. Red ties are 50% more expensive than blue ties, so the price ratio of red ties to blue ties is 1.5:1.
3. John spent $200 on each blue tie that costs $40, so the total cost of blue ties is 2 * $200 = $400.
4. Since the price ratio of red ties to blue ties is 1.5:1, the total cost of red ties is 1.5 * $400 = $600.

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's first calculate the total number of oranges in the basket. We know that there is one rotten orange, two sour oranges, and the rest are in good condition. So, the total number of oranges is 1 + 2 + the number of oranges in good condition. We also know that 20% of the oranges are still green. If we assume that the number of oranges in good condition is x, then we can write the equation: x + 1 + 2 + 0.2x = 25. Simplifying the equation, we get 1.2x + 3 = 25. Subtracting 3 from both sides, we get 1.2x = 22. Dividing both sides by 1.2, we get x = 18.33. Since we can't have a fraction of an orange, we round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, there are 18 oranges in good condition. The answer is 18.",False

She has driven 100 miles since the last time she filled up the tank, and it took 4 gallons to fill it up again. The car owner's manual states that the tank can hold 12 gallons of gas. How many miles can Sofia drive on one tank of gas? 

Step-by-Step Answer: Sofia drove 100 miles and it took 4 gallons to fill up the tank. This means that she used 4 gallons to drive 100 miles. To find out how many miles she can drive on one tank of gas, we need to calculate the miles per gallon (MPG). MPG is calculated by dividing the number of miles driven by the number of gallons used. So, 100 miles divided by 4 gallons is 25 miles per gallon. 

Since the tank can hold 12 gallons of gas, Sofia can drive 25 miles per gallon for 12 gallons. To find out how far she can drive on one tank of gas, we multiply the MPG by the number of gallons in the tank. So, 25 miles per gallon multiplied by 12 gallons is 300 miles.

If one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, how many bags of dog food does Cecilia need for the first year? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
- For the first 180 days, Cecilia needs 1 cup of dog food per day.

",Question: ビンセントは3本で$2.50のパッケージか、2本で$1のパッケージで花を買えます。よりお得な価格で、18本の花を買ったら、いくらお得になりますか？,6,"Translation to English: Question: Vincent can buy flowers in a package of 3 for $2.50 or a package of 2 for $1. How much money will he save if he buys 18 flowers at the better price? 
Step-by-Step Answer: 
To find out which package is a better deal, we need to compare the price per flower. 
For the package of 3 flowers for $2.50, the price per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.83 per flower. 
For the package of 2 flowers for $1, the price per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.50 per flower. 
So, the better deal is to buy the package of 2 flowers for $1. 
If Vincent buys 18 flowers at the better price, he would spend 18 * $0.50 = $9. 
If he bought the same number of flowers at the other price, he would spend 18 * $0.83 = $14.94. 
Therefore, he would save $14.94 - $9 = $5.94.

Therefore, we can write the equation x + (x + 8) = 22. Simplifying this equation, we get 2x + 8 = 22. Subtracting 8 from both sides, we have 2x = 14. Dividing both sides by 2, we find x = 7.

The company has a policy of increasing the salary of employees who have been with the company for 5 years by 10% each year. If Sylvie reached her 5th year of employment in December of last year, how much will her annual salary be after she works for another 3 years?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Sylvie's initial salary is $600 per month.

3. To calculate the salary after 5 years, we need to calculate the increase for each year and add it to the initial salary.
4. The increase for the first year is 10% of $600, which is $60. So the salary after the first year is $600 + $60 = $660.
5. The increase for the second year is 10% of $660, which is $66. So the salary after the second year is $660 + $66 = $726.

","Question: マリリンの最初のレコードはハラルドの10倍売れました。彼らが合わせて88,000枚売っていた場合、ハラルドは何枚売りましたか？",8000,"Translation to English: Question: Marilyn's first record sold 10 times more than Harold's. If they sold a total of 88,000 records, how many records did Harold sell? 

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume that Harold sold x records. According to the information given, Marilyn's record sold 10 times more than Harold's, so Marilyn sold 10x records. 

The total number of records sold is the sum of Marilyn's and Harold's sales, which is 10x + x = 11x. 

We are given that the total number of records sold is 88,000, so we can set up the equation 11x = 88,000. 

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 11: x = 88,000 / 11 = 8,000. 

Therefore, Harold sold 8,000 records.

1. Each 16-ounce tomato can contains 3 tomatoes.

In the end, he also drinks a glass before going to bed. John does this every weekday, but on weekends, he wants to relax and drinks soda instead during dinner. How many times more water does he drink in a week? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
- John drinks a glass of water during breakfast, lunch, and dinner, so that's 3 glasses of water per day.
- He also drinks a glass of water before going to bed, so that's an additional 1 glass of water per day.
- On weekdays, he does this routine, so he drinks a total of 4 glasses of water per day.
- In a week, there are 5 weekdays, so he drinks 4 glasses of water x 5 days = 20 glasses of water.
- On weekends, he drinks soda instead of water during dinner, so he doesn't drink an additional glass of water.
- Therefore, he drinks 20 glasses of water in a week.

It takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles of the city. If the city is 42 miles from the seaside to the opposite end of the land, how long does it take for the fog to cover the entire city? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
To cover 3 miles, it takes 10 minutes.
To cover 6 miles, it takes 20 minutes (2 times 10 minutes).
To cover 9 miles, it takes 30 minutes (3 times 10 minutes).
Therefore, for every 3 miles, it takes 10 minutes.

If the city is 42 miles long, we can divide it by 3 to find out how many sets of 3 miles there are:
42 miles ÷ 3 miles = 14 sets of 3 miles.

Since it takes 10 minutes for each set of 3 miles, we can multiply the number of sets by 10 to find out how long it takes to cover the entire city:
14 sets × 10 minutes = 140 minutes.

Therefore, it takes 140 minutes for the fog to cover the entire city.

She fits 1/4 of the pieces onto the board, and her mother fits the remaining 1/3. How many puzzle pieces are left unfitted?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1/4 of the puzzle pieces are fitted by Poppy.
1/3 of the puzzle pieces are fitted by her mother.
To find the remaining pieces, we need to subtract the fitted pieces from the total number of pieces.
1/4 + 1/3 = 3/12 + 4/12 = 7/12
So, 7/12 of the puzzle pieces are fitted.
To find the remaining pieces, we subtract 7/12 from 1 (the whole puzzle).
1 - 7/12 = 12/12 - 7/12 = 5/12
Therefore, 5/12 of the puzzle pieces are left unfitted.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The volume of each box can be calculated by multiplying the length, width, and height. 
For the first box: 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches = 120 cubic inches. 
Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract the volume of the walls from the total volume of each box. 
The volume of the walls can be calculated by multiplying the surface area of the box (excluding the top) by the thickness of the walls. 
The surface area of the box (excluding the top) is (5 inches x 4 inches) + (6 inches x 4 inches) = 44 square inches. 
So, the volume of the walls is 44 square inches x 1 inch = 44 cubic inches. 
Therefore, the actual volume of each box is 120 cubic inches - 44 cubic inches = 76 cubic inches.

While taking them out to cool, he removes 5 cookies, and now he has a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Let's assume the number of cookies Henry baked last year is x.
Henry wants to bake twice as many as he baked last year, so he wants to bake 2x cookies.
But he ended up baking 15 more cookies than he intended, so the actual number of cookies he baked is 2x + 15.
After removing 5 cookies, he has a total of 110 cookies, so 2x + 15 - 5 = 110.
Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 10 = 110.
Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get 2x = 100.
Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 50.

If they ate all of the rolls, on average how many did they eat?

Step-by-Step Answer: Beatrice's fruit roll is 2 rolls wide and 24 rolls long, so the total number of rolls is 2 * 24 = 48 rolls.

If they ate all of the rolls, on average they ate 90 rolls / 2 people = 45 rolls per person. The answer is 45.",True

Every time she rowed 10 feet towards the shore, 2 liters of water entered the boat. The shore was 64 seconds away. How much water entered the boat before Julia reached the shore?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Julia rows 10 feet towards the shore and 2 liters of water enter the boat.
2. The shore is 64 seconds away.
3. We need to find out how many times Julia rows 10 feet before reaching the shore.
4. To do that, we need to convert the distance to time using the given rate of 10 feet per 2 liters.
5. Since 10 feet is rowed in 64 seconds, we can set up a proportion: 10 feet / 64 seconds = 2 liters / x seconds.
6. Solving for x, we get x = (64 seconds * 2 liters) / 10 feet = 12.8 seconds.
7. This means Julia rows 10 feet every 12.8 seconds.
8. To find out how many times she rows before reaching the shore, we divide 64 seconds by 12.8 seconds: ",False

The maximum number of photos that Brittany's phone can store is 50 times the number of birds in the photos Jamal took at the zoo. If Jamal's phone can store 1800 photos, how many ducks are in the photos Jamal took at the zoo?

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume the number of birds in the photos Jamal took at the zoo is x. 
According to the information given, Brittany's phone can store 50 times the number of birds, so Brittany's phone can store 50x photos. 
Jamal's phone can store 6 times more photos than Brittany's phone, so Jamal's phone can store 6 * 50x = 300x photos. 
If Jamal's phone can store 1800 photos, then we can set up the equation 300x = 1800. 
Solving for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 300: x = 1800 / 300 = 6. 
Therefore, there are 6 ducks in the photos Jamal took at the zoo.

She has decided to sell the remaining lumber. She has 10 pieces of 2 x 4 x 10 boards, each costing $10. She also has 5 pieces of 4 x 4 x 10 boards, which she bought for $16 each. If she sells everything, how much profit will she make? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The cost of each 2 x 4 x 10 board is $10, and she has 10 of them. So the total cost for these boards is 10 x $10 = $100.
The cost of each 4 x 4 x 10 board is $16, and she has 5 of them. So the total cost for these boards is 5 x $16 = $80.
The total cost for all the lumber is $100 + $80 = $180.
Since the price of lumber has increased by 50%, she can sell it for 100% + 50% = 150% of the original cost.
150% of $180 is (150/100) x $180 = $270.

If she uses a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and hot water, calculate how many teaspoons of sugar she used.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. The ratio of sugar to hot water is 7:13.
2. This means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 teaspoons of hot water.
3. If we let x be the number of sets of 7:13 in the total amount of sugar and hot water, we can set up the equation 7x + 13x = 120.
4. Combining like terms, we get 20x = 120.
5. Dividing both sides by 20, we find that x = 6.

If Adrian and Lilia's salaries increased at the same time, and Adrian earned $40,000 4 years ago, how much will their total salary be after 4 years? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Adrian's salary 4 years ago was $40,000.

3. Adrian's total salary is 30% higher than Lilia's salary, so Lilia's salary after 4 years will be $56,000 - ($56,000 * 0.30) = $56,000 - $16,800 = $39,200.

If one pepper costs $15, how much will it cost in total? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The watermelon is priced at 3 times the price of each pepper, so the watermelon costs 3 * $15 = $45.
The orange is $5 cheaper than the watermelon, so the orange costs $45 - $5 = $40.
Dillon sent 4 watermelons, so the total cost of the watermelons is 4 * $45 = $180.
Dillon sent 20 peppers, so the total cost of the peppers is 20 * $15 = $300.
Dillon sent 10 oranges, so the total cost of the oranges is 10 * $40 = $400.

One-third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. Then, 10 more quit after children kick them in the shins. How many elves are left?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1/3 of the 60 elves quit after children vomit on them. 1/3 of 60 is 60/3 = 20. So, 20 elves quit after children vomit on them.

After that, 10 more elves quit after children kick them in the shins.

To find the total number of elves remaining, we subtract the number of elves who quit from the original number of elves.

Original number of elves: 60
Number of elves who quit after children vomit on them: 20
Number of elves who quit after children kick them in the shins: 10

On Tuesday, he walked 6 times the distance he walked on Monday. The total distance he walked from Monday to Wednesday was 41 miles. How many miles did he walk on Wednesday? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Let's assume the distance Walt walked on Tuesday is x miles. 
On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles. 
On Tuesday, he walked 6 times the distance he walked on Monday, so he walked 6 * 4 = 24 miles. 
From Monday to Wednesday, he walked a total of 41 miles, so the sum of the distances he walked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday is 4 + 24 + x = 41. 
Simplifying the equation, we have 28 + x = 41. 
Subtracting 28 from both sides, we get x = 13. 

Therefore, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday.

The cost of the bleach is 6 * $2 = $12 and the cost of the cloth is 3 * $5 = $15. Therefore, her total expenses are $12 + $15 = $27. Her total weekly income is $92. So her profit each week is $92 - $27 = $65.

Step-by-Step Answer: Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 seahorses, and 3 clownfish. Roxin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which is 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The price of one bag of marbles increases by 20% every 2 months. 
After 36 months, there are 36/2 = 18 cycles of price increases. 
Each cycle increases the price by 20% of the original price.

The doll is priced the same as 3 action figures, and one red car costs 4 dollars. If the action figures are priced at 5 dollars each, what is the total value of all the toys? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
- The doll is priced the same as 3 action figures, so the doll is also priced at 5 dollars each.
- One red car costs 4 dollars.
- There are 5 red cars, so the total cost of the red cars is 5 * 4 = 20 dollars.
- There are 3 action figures, and each costs 5 dollars, so the total cost of the action figures is 3 * 5 = 15 dollars.
- There is 1 doll, and it costs 5 dollars.
- Adding up the costs of all the toys, we have 20 dollars for the red cars, 15 dollars for the action figures, and 5 dollars for the doll, which gives us a total of 20 + 15 + 5 = 40 dollars.

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume Brooke's age is x. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's age would be 2x. In 2 years, Brooke's age will be x + 2 and Seth's age will be 2x + 2. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be (x + 2) + (2x + 2) = 3x + 4. According to the question, this sum is equal to 28. So, we can write the equation 3x + 4 = 28.

- Jake sees 80 spiders with 8 legs each, so that's 80 * 8 = 640 legs.
- Jake sees 90 insects with 6 legs each, so that's 90 * 6 = 540 legs.
- Jake sees some rare mutant invertebrates with 10 legs each, but the number of these creatures is not given.

Step-by-Step Answer:

Since it's a big event, he needs to prepare 60 potatoes. The potatoes are approximately the same size, so it takes the same amount of time to peel and cut each potato. It takes Billy 1.5 minutes to peel one potato, but only 5 seconds to cut it. How long will it take Billy to prepare all the potatoes?

Step-by-Step Answer: Billy takes 1.5 minutes to peel one potato and 5 seconds to cut it. Let's convert the time to the same unit. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 1.5 minutes is equal to 1.5 * 60 = 90 seconds. 

To peel and cut one potato, Billy takes 90 seconds for peeling and 5 seconds for cutting, which is a total of 90 + 5 = 95 seconds. 

Since Billy needs to prepare 60 potatoes, he will take 95 seconds per potato multiplied by 60 potatoes, which is 95 * 60 = 5700 seconds. 

Therefore, it will take Billy 5700 seconds to prepare all the potatoes.

1. The total number of participants is 240.
2. Out of these, 80 are Japanese, so the remaining participants are Chinese.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Let's assume Mark's age is x. 
According to the given information, Jane is 2 years older than Mark, so Jane's age would be x + 2. 
Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jane's age, which means Mark's age two years ago was (x + 2)/2 + 5. 
If Jane is currently 30 years old, we can set up the equation: 
(x + 2)/2 + 5 = 30. 
Simplifying the equation, we get: 
(x + 2)/2 = 25. 
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get: 
x + 2 = 50. 
Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get: 
x = 48. 

Therefore, Jane's age is x + 2 = 48 + 2 = 50 years old.

",Question: ジェリーは6面ダイスを振っている。彼が3よりも大きい数を出す確率は、偶数を2回連続で出す確率よりも（何%）高いか？,25,"Translation to English: Question: Jerry is rolling a 6-sided die. What is the percentage by which the probability of him rolling a number greater than 3 is higher than the probability of him rolling two consecutive even numbers? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
To find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3, we need to count the number of favorable outcomes and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes. 

There are 6 possible outcomes when rolling a 6-sided die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Out of these, there are 3 numbers greater than 3: 4, 5, and 6. 

So the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 or 1/2, which is equal to 50%. 

Now let's find the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers. 

There are 3 even numbers on a 6-sided die: 2, 4, and 6. 

To roll two consecutive even numbers, we can have the following outcomes: (2, 4), (4, 6). 

So there are 2 favorable outcomes for rolling two consecutive even numbers.

It costs $2 to transport each bag of wheat from the farm to the warehouse. If the merchant made a profit of $400 by selling the wheat for $30 per bag, how many bags of wheat did the merchant sell? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Let's assume the merchant bought x bags of wheat from the farm.
The cost of buying x bags of wheat from the farm is 20x dollars.
The cost of transporting x bags of wheat from the farm to the warehouse is 2x dollars.
So, the total cost for the merchant is 20x + 2x = 22x dollars.
The merchant sold each bag of wheat for 30 dollars, so the total revenue is 30x dollars.
The profit made by the merchant is the revenue minus the cost, which is 30x - 22x = 8x dollars.
We are given that the profit is 400 dollars, so we can set up the equation 8x = 400.
Solving for x, we find x = 50.
Therefore, the merchant sold 50 bags of wheat.

They bought food for an amount that is $4.50 cheaper than the tickets. They rode a ride that costs $33 per ride twice.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The total cost of the entrance tickets is $20.25.
The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the tickets, so it is $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.
The cost of riding the ride twice is $33 x 2 = $66.
The total expenses for the three friends is $20.25 + $15.75 + $66 = $102.

For every ton of grapes, she can produce 2 barrels of wine, so the total amount of wine she can produce is 50 tons * 2 barrels/ton = 100 barrels of wine.

Mr. Bart gives 6 tests per semester. He allows students to drop their lowest score from each semester when calculating the average. If Brinley scored 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 on her first 5 tests, what score does she need to get on the 6th test in order to have an average of 93?

Step-by-Step Answer: Brinley took 5 tests and her scores were 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. To calculate the average, we need to add up all the scores and divide by the number of tests. (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 5 = 438 / 5 = 87.6. 

To have an average of 93, Brinley needs to score a total of 93 * 6 = 558 points on all 6 tests. She already has 438 points from the first 5 tests. Therefore, she needs to score 558 - 438 = 120 points on the 6th test.

Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as an apple candy. If each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, how much does Joe's candy bag weigh in total? 

Step-by-Step Answer: Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, so the weight of all the chocolate bars is 25 * 40 = 1000 grams. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as an apple candy, each apple candy weighs 40 / 2 = 20 grams. The weight of all the apple candies is 80 * 20 = 1600 grams.

If Sarah already has $10 saved before she starts babysitting, how many times does she need to mow the lawn in order to get the jacket and shoes?

The jacket costs $30 and the shoes are $20 per pair, so 2 pairs of shoes would cost $20 * 2 = $40.
Sarah earns $5 each time she babysits, and she babysits 4 times, so she earns $5 * 4 = $20 from babysitting.
Her parents give her $4 each time she mows the lawn, so she earns $4 * x, where x is the number of times she mows the lawn.
Sarah already has $10 saved, so the total amount she has is $10 + $20 + $4x.

Step-by-Step Answer: Leah had 32 chocolates and Leah’s sister had 42. That means there were originally 32 + 42 = 74 chocolates. 35 have been eaten. So in total they still have 74 - 35 = 39 chocolates. The answer is 39.

Red chickens lay 3 eggs per day and white chickens lay 5 eggs per day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. If he has 2 more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume Jerry has x red chickens. Since he has 2 more white chickens than red chickens, he has x + 2 white chickens. 

Red chickens lay 3 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs laid by red chickens is 3x. White chickens lay 5 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs laid by white chickens is 5(x + 2).

Jerry collects 42 eggs every day, so we can set up the equation: 3x + 5(x + 2) = 42.

Simplifying the equation, we get: 3x + 5x + 10 = 42.
Combining like terms, we get: 8x + 10 = 42.
Subtracting 10 from both sides, we get: 8x = 32.
Dividing both sides by 8, we get: x = 4.

Step-by-Step Answer: To find the total distance Gary walks, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 times the sum of its length and width. In this case, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles. So the perimeter is 2 * (6 + 1.5) = 2 * 7.5 = 15 miles.

Since Gary walks at a pace of 3 miles per hour, we can divide the total distance by his walking speed to find the time he spends walking. 15 miles / 3 miles per hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking. The answer is 5.",True

Step-by-Step Answer: 
On the first day, there were 100 customers.
On the second day, there were 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
Let's assume the number of customers on the third day is x.
So, the total number of customers over the 3 days is 100 + 150 + x = 500.

Four minutes ago, the large pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now, the large pool has four times as much water as the small pool. How much water is in the small pool now? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Let's assume the amount of water in the small pool is x gallons.
Four minutes ago, the large pool had twice as much water as the small pool, so the large pool had 2x gallons of water.
Since both pools have leaks and leak 4 gallons of water per minute, in four minutes, the small pool would have lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water, and the large pool would have lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water as well.
Now, the large pool has four times as much water as the small pool, so the large pool has 4x gallons of water.
Considering the water lost due to leaks, the small pool would have x - 16 gallons of water.
Since the large pool has four times as much water as the small pool, we can set up the equation 4x = x - ",False

",Question: ボードゲームで4人の生徒たちは全部で251ポイント獲得しました。ナオミは68ポイント得ました。ユリはナオミが得たポイントの半分よりも10多くポイントを獲得し、ブリアナはナオミよりも17ポイント多く獲得しました。ジョジョは何ポイント得ましたか？,54,"Translation to English: Question: Four students playing a board game earned a total of 251 points. Naomi earned 68 points. Yuri earned 10 more points than half of Naomi's points, and Briana earned 17 more points than Naomi. How many points did Jojo earn? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Naomi earned 68 points.
Yuri earned 10 more points than half of Naomi's points, which is (68/2) + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 points.
Briana earned 17 more points than Naomi, which is 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. 30% of 1,000 students exited through entrance A, which is 0.3 * 1,000 = 300 students.
2. After 300 students exited through entrance A, there are 1,000 - 300 = 700 students remaining.

",Question: ある水族館にカタツムリが4匹います。別の水族館にはカタツムリが32匹います。両者の差は、両方の水族館にいる魚の合計数の2倍です。それぞれの水族館に同じ数の魚がいるとすると、それぞれの水族館にいる魚は何匹ずつでしょうか？,7,"Translation to English: Question: There are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium. The difference between the two is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Assuming there are the same number of fish in each aquarium, how many fish are there in each aquarium?

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume that there are x fish in each aquarium. The total number of fish in both aquariums is 2x. According to the given information, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 2x. So, we can set up the equation 32 - 4 = 2x. Simplifying this equation, we get 28 = 2x. Dividing both sides by 2, we find that x = 14. Therefore, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.

The movie he is starring in requires extensive makeup, which takes 6 hours each time and needs to be done 4 times a week. The movie lasted for 5 weeks. After the movie was completed, the makeup artist gave Gene a 10% discount because of the large payment. How much did Gene pay? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
- Gene needs makeup 4 times a week for 5 weeks, so a total of 4 * 5 = 20 makeup sessions were required.
- Each makeup session takes 6 hours, so in total, Gene spent 20 * 6 = 120 hours on makeup.
- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost without the discount would be 120 * $250 = $30,000.
- With a 10% discount, Gene would pay 90% of the original cost, which is 0.9 * $30,000 = $27,000.

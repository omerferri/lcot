The value of the house then increases by 150%. What profit did he make? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Josh buys the house for $80,000 and invests $50,000 in its restoration. 
2. The value of the house increases by 150%, which means it becomes 150% of its original value. 
3. To calculate the new value of the house, we multiply the original value by 1.5 (150% expressed as a decimal). 
   New value of the house = $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000. 
4. To calculate the profit, we subtract the total investment from the new value of the house. 
   Profit = $120,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000) = $120,000 - $130,000 = -$10,000.

1. Carlos needs to cover the initial cost of planting, which is $90.
2. Each year, the tree will produce 7 lemons, which can be sold for a total of 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.
3. However, Carlos also needs to subtract the cost of watering and nourishing the tree, which is $3 per year.
4. So, Carlos will make a profit of $10.5 - $3 = $7.5 per year.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Let's assume Mélanie initially had x vacuum cleaners.
She sold one third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which is (1/3)x.
Then she sold 2 more at the red house, which is (1/3)x - 2.
After that, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is ((1/3)x - 2)/2.
So, the equation becomes ((1/3)x - 2)/2 = 5.
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get (1/3)x - 2 = 10.
Adding 2 to both sides, we get (1/3)x = 12.

Quel est le prix initial du livre ?",26,"Translation to English: Question: Kyle bought last year's best-selling book for $19.50, with a 25% discount on the original price. What is the original price of the book? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Let's assume the original price of the book is x dollars. 
Kyle received a 25% discount on the original price, which means he paid 75% of the original price. 
So, 75% of x dollars is equal to $19.50. 
We can write this as an equation: 
0.75x = $19.50. 
To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75: 
x = $19.50 / 0.75. 
Evaluating this expression, we find that x is equal to $26.

Marie paid a total of $50. If each pizza box costs $8.50, how many boxes did Marie order? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The chicken dish costs $12. 
The 5 cartons of milk cost 5 * $3 = $15. 
The 4 apples cost 4 * $1.50 = $6. 
Let's assume Marie ordered x pizza boxes. 
So, the total cost of the pizza boxes is x * $8.50 = $8.50x. 
The total cost of Marie's order is $12 + $15 + $6 + $8.50x = $50. 
Combining like terms, we have $8.50x + $33 = $50. 
Subtracting $33 from both sides, we get $8.50x = $17. 
Dividing both sides by $8.50, we find x = 2. 
Therefore, Marie ordered 2 pizza boxes.

However, she has to choose between the ankle boots and two pairs of high heels that together cost five dollars less than the ankle boots. If one pair of high heels costs $33 and the other pair costs twice as much, what is the price of the ankle boots in dollars? 

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume the price of the ankle boots is x dollars. The total cost of the two pairs of high heels is (33 + 2x) dollars. According to the given information, the cost of the high heels is five dollars less than the ankle boots, so we can set up the equation: (33 + 2x) = (x - 5). 

Simplifying the equation, we get: 33 + 2x = x - 5. 

Subtracting x from both sides, we get: x = -38. 

Since the price of the ankle boots cannot be negative, we can conclude that there is no solution to this equation. Therefore, there is no price for the ankle boots that satisfies the given conditions.

We know that the sum of their current ages is 162, so we can set up the equation 18x = 162. Solving for x, we find that x = 9.

He asks his friends to estimate the quantity. One of them answers 80. Another says 20 more than half of the first. A third one talks about 25% more than the first. What is the average of their estimates? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The first friend estimates 80 candies.
The second friend estimates 20 more than half of the first friend's estimate. Half of 80 is 40, so the second friend estimates 40 + 20 = 60 candies.
The third friend estimates 25% more than the first friend's estimate. 25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20, so the third friend estimates 80 + 20 = 100 candies.

To find the average of their estimates, we add up all the estimates and divide by the number of estimates.

",Question: Gretchen a 110 pièces. Les pièces en or comptent 30 pièces de plus que celles en argent. Combien Gretchen a-t-elle de pièces en or ?,70,"Translation to English: Question: Gretchen has 110 coins. The gold coins count 30 more than the silver coins. How many gold coins does Gretchen have?
Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume Gretchen has x silver coins. According to the information given, the number of gold coins is 30 more than the number of silver coins. So, the number of gold coins is x + 30. The total number of coins Gretchen has is the sum of the silver and gold coins, which is x + (x + 30) = 110. Simplifying the equation, we get 2x + 30 = 110. Subtracting 30 from both sides, we have 2x = 80. Dividing both sides by 2, we find x = 40. Therefore, Gretchen has 40 silver coins and the number of gold coins is 40 + 30 = 70.

After buying the video games, he has $5 left. So, he had $195 - $160 = $35 before buying the video games. Since each Lego game costs $15, he can buy $35 / $15 = 2 Lego games.

",Question: Jean court 60 miles chaque semaine. Il court 3 jours par semaine. Le premier jour il court pendant 3 heures et court deux fois moins les deux autres jours.

On the first day, he runs for 3 hours and runs half as much on the other two days. What is his running speed? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
On the first day, Jean runs for 3 hours, which is equivalent to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes. 
Let's assume that on the other two days, he runs for x minutes each day. 
So, the total running time for the other two days is 2 * x minutes. 
Since he runs half as much on the other two days, we can write the equation: 
180 = 2 * x / 2 
Simplifying the equation, we get: 
180 = x 
Therefore, Jean runs for 180 minutes on the first day and 180 minutes on the other two days. 
His total running time for the week is 180 + 180 + 180 = 540 minutes. 
To find his running speed, we divide the total distance (60 miles) by the total time (540 minutes): 
60 miles / 540 minutes = 0.111 miles per minute.

If she jumps at a speed of 3 miles per hour, how many miles does she travel in six hours, knowing that she spends 1/3 of the time running and 2/3 walking? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Let's assume that Dana's walking speed is x miles per hour. 
2. According to the given information, Dana runs four times faster than she walks, so her running speed is 4x miles per hour. 
3. Dana jumps half as fast as she runs, so her jumping speed is (1/2) * 4x = 2x miles per hour.

Polly pouvait lancer le javelot d'or, la seule arme capable de transpercer le dragon, mais sur une distance de 400 pieds, largement à portée de ses flammes. Toutefois, lorsque Polly tenait la pierre de saphir, elle pouvait le lancer trois fois plus loin. En tenant la pierre précieuse, à quelle distance Polly pouvait-elle se maintenir hors de portée des flammes, tout en parvenant à frapper le dragon avec le javelot d'or ?",200,"Translation to English: Question: Perg, the great dragon, was sitting at the top of Mount Farbo and spewing fire over a distance of 1,000 feet. Polly could throw the golden javelin, the only weapon capable of piercing the dragon, but over a distance of 400 feet, well within range of its flames. However, when Polly held the sapphire stone, she could throw it three times as far. Holding the precious stone, at what distance could Polly stay out of reach of the flames while still managing to hit the dragon with the golden javelin?

Step-by-Step Answer: Without the sapphire stone, Polly can throw the golden javelin up to 400 feet. With the sapphire stone, she can throw it three times as far, which is 400 * 3 = 1200 feet. Since Perg, the dragon, can spew fire up to 1000 feet, Polly needs to be at a distance greater than 1000 feet to stay out of reach of the flames. Therefore, Polly can stay at a distance of 1200 feet while still being able to hit the dragon with the golden javelin. 

The answer is 1200 feet.",False

If a 300g bag contains 5 servings, how many grams of chips will you eat, knowing that your daily calorie goal is 2,000 and you have already consumed 1,800 calories? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
- Each serving of chips contains 250 calories.
- The bag of chips contains 5 servings.
- So, the total number of calories in the bag of chips is 250 * 5 = 1250 calories.
- Your daily calorie goal is 2,000 calories and you have already consumed 1,800 calories.
- Therefore, you have 2,000 - 1,800 = 200 calories left to consume.
- To find out how many grams of chips you can eat, we need to calculate the ratio of calories to grams.
- The ratio of calories to grams is 1250 calories / 300 grams = 4.17 calories per gram.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Lloyd's hens produce 252 eggs per day.

The truck is filled with identical boxes, weighing 15 pounds each. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3,755 pounds. How many boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge? 

Step-by-Step Answer: The weight limit of the bridge is 5,000 pounds. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3,755 pounds. To find out how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck, we need to subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the weight limit of the bridge. 

5,000 - 3,755 = 1,245 

Each box weighs 15 pounds. To find out how many boxes can be loaded onto the truck, we need to divide the remaining weight limit by the weight of each box. 

1,245 ÷ 15 = 83 

Therefore, 83 boxes can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the weight limit of the bridge. 

The answer is 83.",True

Step-by-Step Answer: 
- Aleena pays $140 per month for the first half of the year. There are 12 months in a year, so the first half is 12/2 = 6 months.
- For the first 6 months, Aleena pays $140 * 6 = $840.
- For the second half of the year, Aleena pays 10% less than $140 per month. 10% of $140 is $140 * 0.10 = $14.
- So, for the second half of the year, Aleena pays $140 - $14 = $126 per month.
- There are also 6 months in the second half of the year, so Aleena pays $126 * 6 = $756.

Comme il n'a pas de monnaie aujourd'hui, Artie décide d'arrondir tous ses prix au dollar le plus proche. S'il vend 12 pots de soucis, 9 pots de pétunias et 17 pots de bégonias, combien d'argent gagnera-t-il ?",88,"Translation to English: Question: Artie sells flowers at the farmer's market. He sells three types: marigolds, petunias, and begonias. He usually sells marigolds for $2.74 per pot, petunias for $1.87 per pot, and begonias for $2.12 per pot. Since he doesn't have any change today, Artie decides to round all his prices to the nearest dollar. If he sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias, and 17 pots of begonias, how much money will he earn? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The price of marigolds is $2.74 per pot. Rounded to the nearest dollar, it becomes $3 per pot. 
Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds, so he earns 12 * $3 = $36 from marigolds. 
The price of petunias is $1.87 per pot. Rounded to the nearest dollar, it becomes $2 per pot. 
Artie sells 9 pots of petunias, so he earns 9 * $2 = $18 from petunias.

He notices that each level of a sand castle has half the surface area of the lower level. What is the average surface area of a level, knowing that the sand castle has 4 levels and the highest level has an area of 16 square feet? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The highest level has an area of 16 square feet. 
The level below it has twice the surface area, so it has 16 * 2 = 32 square feet. 
The level below that has twice the surface area of the previous level, so it has 32 * 2 = 64 square feet. 
The lowest level has twice the surface area of the previous level, so it has 64 * 2 = 128 square feet. 

To find the average surface area, we add up the surface areas of all the levels and divide by the number of levels. 
16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet. 
There are 4 levels, so the average surface area is 240 / 4 = 60 square feet.

To find the best price, we need to compare the cost of buying 18 flowers in packs of 3 and in packs of 2. 

If Vincent buys 18 flowers in packs of 3, he will need 18/3 = 6 packs. 
The cost of 6 packs of 3 flowers each is 6 * $2.50 = $15. 

If Vincent buys 18 flowers in packs of 2, he will need 18/2 = 9 packs.

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's say the team won x times. Since they won _ times more than they lost, they lost x/_ times. 

The total number of matches played is the sum of the number of wins and the number of losses, which is x + x/_ = 22. 

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides of the equation by _ to get rid of the fraction: _x + x = 22_. 

Combining like terms, we have (_ + 1)x = 22_. 

Dividing both sides of the equation by (_ + 1), we get x = 22/(_ + 1).

It has a policy of adding 10% to the initial salary of each employee who has five years of seniority. If Sylvie just completed 5 years in the company last December, what will her annual salary be after three more years of service? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Sylvie's initial salary is $600 per month. To calculate her annual salary, we need to multiply her monthly salary by 12. So her initial annual salary is $600 * 12 = $7200.

According to the company's policy, after 5 years of service, Sylvie's salary will be increased by 10%. To calculate the increase, we need to multiply her initial annual salary by 10% and add it to her initial annual salary. 

10% of $7200 is $7200 * 0.10 = $720.

So after 5 years of service, Sylvie's annual salary will be $7200 + $720 = $7920.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
- Let's start by finding the total number of cats. Since there are two cats for each dog, we can multiply the number of dogs by 2: 60 dogs * 2 cats/dog = 120 cats.
- Now let's find the total number of dogs, cats, and rabbits combined. We add the number of dogs (60), the number of cats (120), and subtract twelve units for the rabbits: 60 dogs + 120 cats - 12 rabbits = 168 pets.

Combien de plantes en pot restera-t-il à Marie ?",58,"Translation to English: Question: Marie loves gardening. Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants from her favorite nursery. She already had 2 on each of the 40 windowsills in her large country house. So, she decided that tomorrow, she will take 1 potted plant from each windowsill and generously give them to friends and family. How many potted plants will Marie have left?

Step-by-Step Answer: Marie had 2 potted plants on each of the 40 windowsills, which is a total of 2 * 40 = 80 potted plants. She received 18 new potted plants, so she now has 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants. Tomorrow, she will give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 windowsills, which means she will have 98 - 40 = 58 potted plants left.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The first friend rang the doorbell 20 times.
The second friend rang it 1/4 times more than the first, which is 1/4 * 20 = 5 times more. So the second friend rang it 20 + 5 = 25 times.
The third friend rang it 10 times more than the fourth, who rang it 60 times. So the third friend rang it 10 * 60 = 600 times.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
To find out how many minutes it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we need to determine how many sets of 3 miles are in 42 miles. 

42 miles divided by 3 miles is equal to 14 sets of 3 miles. 

Since it takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles, it will take 10 minutes multiplied by 14 sets of 3 miles to cover the entire city. 

10 minutes multiplied by 14 is equal to 140 minutes.

The boat started taking two liters of water every ten feet rowed towards the shore. It took her sixteen seconds to travel twenty feet. The shore is at 64 seconds, how much water had the boat taken when Julia reached the shore? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
- The boat takes 2 liters of water every 10 feet rowed towards the shore.
- Julia traveled 20 feet in 16 seconds.
- To find out how much water the boat had taken when Julia reached the shore, we need to calculate the number of 10-feet intervals she rowed.
- Since it took her 16 seconds to travel 20 feet, we can calculate the number of 10-feet intervals by dividing 20 by 10, which is 2.
- So, Julia rowed 2 intervals of 10 feet each.
- Since the boat takes 2 liters of water for every 10 feet rowed, we can calculate the total amount of water taken by multiplying 2 by 2, which is 4 liters.
- Therefore, when Julia reached the shore, the boat had taken 4 liters of water.

Step-by-Step Answer: Sasha has ten boards of 2 x 4 x 10, which cost $10 each. So the total cost for these boards is 10 x $10 = $100. She also has five boards of 4 x 4 x 10, which cost $16 each. So the total cost for these boards is 5 x $16 = $80. 

To calculate the profit, we need to subtract the total cost from the total selling price. Since the prices have increased by 50%, Sasha can sell the boards for 1.5 times their original cost. 

The selling price for the ten boards of 2 x 4 x 10 would be 10 x $10 x 1.5 = $150.

Calculate the number of teaspoons she poured, knowing that she used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water.
Step-by-Step Answer: The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is 7:13. This means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, Katy uses 13 cups of water. 
To find the total number of teaspoons she poured, we need to find the number of sets of 7 teaspoons in 120. 
120 divided by 7 is equal to 17 with a remainder of 1.

If there are 12 blue gumballs, how many pink gumballs are there? 

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume the number of pink gumballs is x. According to the information given, there are 22 times more blue gumballs than four times the amount of pink gumballs. So, the number of blue gumballs is 4x * 22. We are also given that there are 12 blue gumballs. 

Therefore, we can set up the equation 4x * 22 = 12. 

To solve for x, we divide both sides of the equation by 88 (4 * 22). 

4x * 22 / 88 = 12 / 88 

Simplifying, we get 4x = 12 / 88 

Dividing both sides by 4, we get x = (12 / 88) / 4 

Calculating, x = 0.034

What is the percentage of semi-automatic cars? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars, we need to first calculate the number of semi-automatic cars. 
There are a total of 20 cars available. 
Out of these, 12 are automatic cars and 4 are manual cars. 
So, the number of semi-automatic cars can be calculated by subtracting the sum of automatic and manual cars from the total number of cars: 20 - 12 - 4 = 4. 
Therefore, there are 4 semi-automatic cars. 

To find the percentage, we need to divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and then multiply by 100: (4/20) * 100 = 20%.

Step-by-Step Answer: The price for 1 child ticket is $10 and the price for 1 adult ticket is $12. The total amount of money given to the cashier is the sum of these two prices, which is $10 + $12 = $22. If the mother received a difference of $8, it means she gave the cashier $22 + $8 = $30.

If Charlie has 12 Facebook friends, how many does Jacques have? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothée, so if Dorothée has x friends, Charlie has 3x friends.
2. Jacques has four times as many friends as Dorothée, so Jacques has 4x friends.
3. We are given that Charlie has 12 friends, so we can set up the equation 3x = 12.

If Tim travels on a skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner wait at home before the loser finishes the race? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
To find the time it takes for each person to travel, we need to divide the distance by the speed. 
For Steve: 3 miles / 440 feet per minute = 0.0068 hours (rounded to 4 decimal places)
For Tim: 2 miles / 264 feet per minute = 0.0076 hours (rounded to 4 decimal places)

To find the time difference, we subtract the time it takes for the slower person from the time it takes for the faster person.
Time difference = 0.0076 hours - 0.0068 hours = 0.0008 hours (rounded to 4 decimal places)

To convert the time difference to minutes, we multiply by 60.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
To find the total length in feet, we need to convert the measurements to feet.

The length of the rolls is 300 * 4 inches = 1200 inches. 
Converting to feet, we have 1200 inches / 12 inches = 100 feet. 

The length of the croissants is 120 * 6 inches = 720 inches. 
Converting to feet, we have 720 inches / 12 inches = 60 feet. 

The length of the baguettes is 60 * 2 feet = 120 feet.

They decide to do it on a 100-yard long football field. Blake does 15 round trips. Kelly does one round trip, then decides she doesn't want to run alongside Blake. So she starts doing the round trip, limiting herself to the 40-yard line. She does it 34 times. How many yards did the winner run more than the loser? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
- Blake does 15 round trips on the 100-yard field, which means he ran a total of 15 * 100 = 1500 yards.
- Kelly does one round trip on the 100-yard field, which means she ran a total of 1 * 100 = 100 yards.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The bag of marbles starts at $20. 
After the first two months, the price increases by 20%, which is 20% of $20 = $4. So the price after two months is $20 + $4 = $24. 
After the next two months, the price increases by another 20%, which is 20% of $24 = $4.80. So the price after four months is $24 + $4.80 = $28.80. 
This pattern continues every two months, with the price increasing by 20% of the previous price. 
After 36 months, there are 36/2 = 18 two-month periods.

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume Brooke's age is x. According to the information given, Seth is 2 times older than Brooke, so Seth's age is 2x. 

In two years, Brooke's age will be x + 2 and Seth's age will be 2x + 2. The sum of their ages in two years will be (x + 2) + (2x + 2) = 3x + 4. 

According to the question, the sum of their ages in two years will be 28. So, we can write the equation 3x + 4 = 28. 

Solving this equation, we subtract 4 from both sides: 3x = 24. Then, we divide both sides by 3: x = 8. 

Therefore, Brooke's age is 8 and Seth's age is 2 times older, which is 2 * 8 = 16.

Step-by-Step Answer: Leah had 32 chocolates and Leah’s sister had 42. That means there were originally 32 + 42 = 74 chocolates. 35 have been eaten. So in total they still have 74 - 35 = 39 chocolates. The answer is 39.
","Question: Sandra, la fleuriste du coin, est très mécontente de la livraison incomplète effectuée par Fred. Sandra avait commandé quatre fois plus de roses rouges que d'œillets blancs. Elle avait également commandé 200 lys de calla roses, soit cinq fois la quantité d'œillets blancs. Sandra a menacé de changer de fournisseur si les roses rouges manquantes ne sont pas livrées avant 17 heures. Pour garder Sandra comme cliente, combien de roses rouges Fred doit-il livrer avant 17 heures ?",160,"Translation to English: Question: Sandra, the local florist, is very unhappy with the incomplete delivery made by Fred. Sandra had ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. She also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which is five times the quantity of white carnations. Sandra threatened to change suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered before 5 p.m. To keep Sandra as a customer, how many red roses does Fred have to deliver before 5 p.m.? 

Step-by-Step Answer: Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Let's say she ordered x white carnations. That means she ordered 4x red roses. 

Sandra also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which is five times the quantity of white carnations. Since she ordered x white carnations, she ordered 5x pink calla lilies. 

To keep Sandra as a customer, Fred needs to deliver the missing red roses before 5 p.m. The missing red roses are the difference between what Sandra ordered (4x) and what she already received. 

So, Fred needs to deliver 4x - (x + 5x) red roses before 5 p.m.

","Question: Jean a deux ans de plus que Marc. Il y a deux ans, Marc avait 5 ans de plus que la moitié de l'âge de Jan.

If Jan is 30 years old, how old is Jean? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Let's start by finding Marc's age. Two years ago, Marc was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. So, half of Jan's age two years ago was (30-2)/2 = 14 years. Therefore, Marc's age two years ago was 14 + 5 = 19 years. 

Since Jean is two years older than Marc, Jean's age two years ago was 19 + 2 = 21 years. 

Now, let's find Jean's current age. If Jean's age two years ago was 21 years, then his current age is 21 + 2 = 23 years.

One of the teams is very well-trained and each of its members completes their 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. The other team is less well-trained.

For the less well-trained team, the first runner completes 400 meters in 60 seconds. The second runner is 3 seconds faster, so they complete their 400 meters in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.

What is the probability (in percentage) that he gets a number greater than 3 rather than an even number two times in a row?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
To find the probability of getting a number greater than 3, we need to determine the number of favorable outcomes and divide it by the total number of possible outcomes.

1. Number of favorable outcomes for getting a number greater than 3: There are 3 numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die, which are 4, 5, and 6.

2. Number of favorable outcomes for getting an even number two times in a row: There are 3 even numbers on a six-sided die, which are 2, 4, and 6. To get an even number two times in a row, we need to multiply the probabilities of getting an even number on each roll. So the probability is (3/6) * (3/6) = 9/36.

3. Total number of possible outcomes: There are 6 possible outcomes on a six-sided die.

Knowing that the transportation of one bag from the farm to the warehouse costs $2 and that all the bags were sold for $30 per bag for a total profit of $400, how many bags did he sell? 

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume the merchant bought x bags of wheat from the farmer. The cost of transportation for each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost is 2x dollars. The selling price for each bag is $30, so the total revenue from selling the bags is 30x dollars. The profit is the revenue minus the cost, so we have the equation 30x - (20x + 2x) = 400. Simplifying this equation, we get 30x - 22x = 400. Combining like terms, we have 8x = 400. Dividing both sides by 8, we find x = 50. Therefore, the merchant sold 50 bags of wheat.

S'ils ont convenu de partager les frais équitablement, combien chacun a-t-il payé ?",34,"Translation to English: Question: Three friends spent $20.25 for 3 fair tickets. They also spent $4.50 less for food than they did for the tickets. They also took 2 rides on a carousel at $33 per ride. If they agreed to split the expenses equally, how much did each person pay? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
The total cost of the fair tickets is $20.25. Since there are 3 friends, each person paid $20.25 / 3 = $6.75 for the tickets.

The food cost $4.50 less than the tickets, so each person paid $6.75 - $4.50 = $2.25 for the food.

The total cost of the carousel rides is $33 per ride * 2 rides = $66. Since there are 3 friends, each person paid $66 / 3 = $22 for the rides.

Adding up the costs for the tickets, food, and rides, each person paid $6.75 + $2.25 + $22 = $31.

Si, lors des cinq premiers tests, Brinley a obtenu des notes de 89, 71, 92, 100 et 86, quelle note doit-elle obtenir au sixième test pour avoir une moyenne de 93 ?",98,"Translation to English: Question: Brinley is in Mr. Bert's math class. He gives six tests per semester. He allows students to drop their lowest average each semester. If, on the first five tests, Brinley got scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86, what score does she need on the sixth test to have an average of 93? 

Step-by-Step Answer: Brinley has taken five tests and we know her scores for those tests. To find out what score she needs on the sixth test, we need to calculate the average of her first five scores and then find the difference between that average and 93. 

The average of her first five scores is (89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86) / 5 = 87.6. 

To have an average of 93, she needs a total of 93 * 6 = 558 points for all six tests. 

So far, she has earned 87.6 * 5 = 438 points. 

To find out what score she needs on the sixth test, we subtract the points she has earned so far from the total points needed: 558 - 438 = ",False

- If the chocolate bar weighs 40 g, then a candy apple weighs half of that, which is 40 g / 2 = 20 g. 
- Joe has 25 chocolate bars, so the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 * 40 g = 1000 g. 
- Joe also has 80 candy apples, so the total weight of the candy apples is 80 * 20 g = 1600 g.

Calculez le prix d'une tasse.,145,"Translation to English: Question: Twenty dozens of cups cost $1,200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6,000 each. Calculate the price of one cup.
Step-by-Step Answer: 
Let's first calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
Half a dozen is equal to 6 plates. 
So, the total cost of half a dozen plates is 6 * $6,000 = $36,000. 

Now, let's calculate the cost of twenty dozens of cups. 
Twenty dozens is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 cups. 
Let's assume the price of one cup is x dollars. 
So, the total cost of twenty dozens of cups is 240 * x = 240x dollars. 

According to the given information, the cost of twenty dozens of cups is $1,200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. 
Therefore, we can write the equation: 
240x = $36,000 - $1,200. 

Simplifying the equation, we have: 
240x = $34,800. 

To find the price of one cup, we divide both sides of the equation by 240:

The total number of eggs produced by the red hens is 3 * x. 
The total number of eggs produced by the white hens is 5 * (x + 2).

","Question: Au magasin à un dollar, Sloane compte 100 clients qui entrent dans le magasin. Le lendemain, elle en compte 50 de plus que le premier jour. Si le troisième jour, le nombre total de clients était de 500, combien de clients a-t-elle comptés ce jour-là ?",250,"Translation to English: Question: At the dollar store, Sloane counts 100 customers entering the store. The next day, she counts 50 more than the first day. If the total number of customers on the third day was 500, how many customers did she count that day? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
On the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers.
On the second day, she counted 50 more than the first day, so that's 100 + 50 = 150 customers.
On the third day, the total number of customers was 500.
To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to subtract the number of customers on the first two days from the total number of customers on the third day.
So, 500 - (100 + 150) = 500 - 250 = 250.
Therefore, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day.

A présent, elle en a quatre fois plus. Quelle est la quantité d'eau de la petite piscine maintenant ?",8,"Translation to English: Question: Jerry has two pools, both with leaks that drain them at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. 4 minutes ago, the large pool had twice as much water as the small one. Now, it has four times as much. What is the amount of water in the small pool now? 

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's assume the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago was x gallons. Since the large pool had twice as much water, it had 2x gallons. 

In 4 minutes, both pools would have lost 4 * 4 = 16 gallons of water each. 

Now, the large pool has four times as much water as the small pool. So, the amount of water in the large pool now is 4 * x gallons. 

Since both pools have lost the same amount of water, we can set up the equation: 

4x - 16 = 4 * x 

Simplifying the equation, we get: 

4x - 4x = 16 

0 = 16 

This equation has no solution, which means there is no amount of water that satisfies the given conditions. 

Therefore, the amount of water in the small pool now",False

She then managed to collect rainwater, which is twice as much as what was left. How many liters of water are now in the tank? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
- The water tank initially had 120 liters of water.
- Celine used 90 liters of water, so there were 120 - 90 = 30 liters left.

If he loses 8 water type cards and buys 14 grass type cards, what is the percentage chance (rounded to the nearest whole number) that a randomly chosen card will be water type?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
James originally had 40 water type cards. He loses 8 and now has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.
He buys 14 grass type cards, so now he has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.
In total, he has 30 fire type cards, 34 grass type cards, and 32 water type cards.
The probability of choosing a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, which is 32 / (30 + 34 + 32) = 32 / 96 = 0.3333.

He pays 10% tax on the cars, and then an additional $1,000 for the registration of each car. How much does he spend in total? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
- Marc buys 12 cars, and each car costs $20,000. So the total cost of the cars is 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.
- He also has to pay 10% tax on the cars. 10% of $240,000 is $240,000 * 0.10 = $24,000.
- Additionally, he has to pay $1,000 for the registration of each car. Since he bought 12 cars, the total registration cost is 12 * $1,000 = $12,000.
- To find the total amount he spends, we add the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration cost: $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Let's assume that Robert has x candies.
2. Jacques has 6 more candies than Robert, so Jacques has x + 6 candies.
3. Jean has twice as many candies as Robert, so Jean has 2x candies.
4. We are given that Jean has 54 candies, so 2x = 54.
5. Solving for x, we find that x = 27.
6. Jacques has x + 6 candies, which is 27 + 6 = 33 candies.

Billy took twice as many as Kyle, so Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries.
After Billy took fries, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.

Once the film is finished, the makeup artist gives Jeanne a 10% discount due to the amount of work done. How much did Jeanne pay? 

Step-by-Step Answer: 
- Jeanne needs makeup for 6 hours per day, 4 times a week, for 5 weeks. 
- So, the total number of hours of makeup is 6 * 4 * 5 = 120 hours. 
- The makeup artist charges $250 per hour, so the total cost of makeup is 120 * $250 = $30,000. 
- After the film is finished, Jeanne receives a 10% discount, which is $30,000 * 0.10 = $3,000. 
- Therefore, Jeanne paid $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000.

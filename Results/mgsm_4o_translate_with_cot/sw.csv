Yuko umbali upi kutoka nyumbani mwishoni mwa saa hizo 4?",45,"Translation to English: Question: John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 miles per hour and then turns around because he realizes he forgot something very important at home. He tries to return home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in a traffic jam. He spends the next half hour driving at a speed of 30 miles per hour, before being able to drive the remaining time at a speed of 80 miles per hour. How far is he from home at the end of those 4 hours?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the distance John drove initially:
   - Speed = 60 miles per hour
   - Time = 3 hours
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 3 hours = 180 miles

2. Calculate the distance John drove while trying to return home:
   - He spends the first 2 hours in traffic, so he covers 0 miles in those 2 hours.
   - For the next half hour, he drives at 30 miles per hour:
     - Speed = 30 miles per hour
     - Time = 0.5 hours
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 0.5 hours = 15 miles
   - For the remaining 1.5 hours, he drives at 80 miles per hour:
     - Speed = 80 miles per hour
     - Time = 1.5 hours
     - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 miles/hour × 1.5 hours = 120 miles

3. Calculate the total distance John drove while trying to return home:
   - Total distance = 0 miles (traffic) + 15 miles (half hour) + 120 miles (remaining time) = 135 miles

4. Calculate how far John is from home:
   - Initially, he drove 180 miles away from home.
   - He drove 135 miles back towards home.
   - Distance from home = Initial distance - Distance driven back = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles

She sold one-third of her vacuum cleaners in the green house, 2 more in the red house, and half of the remaining in the orange house. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, how many did she start with?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Let the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with be \( x \).
2. She sold one-third of her vacuum cleaners in the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) there.
3. After selling in the green house, she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. She then sold 2 more in the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
5. She sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners in the orange house, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) there.
6. After selling in the orange house, she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left.
7. We know she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5

8. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10

   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12

1. First, calculate the number of students who registered for modern dance:
   20% of 20 students = 0.20 * 20 = 4 students.

2. Subtract the students who registered for modern dance from the total number of students:
   20 - 4 = 16 students remaining.

3. Next, calculate the number of students who registered for jazz dance:
   25% of the remaining 16 students = 0.25 * 16 = 4 students.

4. Subtract the students who registered for jazz dance from the remaining students:
   16 - 4 = 12 students remaining.

5. These remaining 12 students registered for hip-hop dance.

6. To find the percentage of all students who registered for hip-hop dance:
   (Number of students registered for hip-hop dance / Total number of students) * 100
   (12 / 20) * 100 = 60%.

The answer is 60%.",True,255,256,True

If the businessman wants to have the highest profit at the end of this month by making a choice, what will be the amount of profit?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the profit from the jewelry:
   - Initial value of jewelry: $5,000
   - Percentage increase: 2.5%
   - Profit from jewelry = $5,000 * (2.5 / 100) = $5,000 * 0.025 = $125

2. Calculate the profit from the electronics:
   - Initial value of electronics: $8,000
   - Percentage increase: 1.2%
   - Profit from electronics = $8,000 * (1.2 / 100) = $8,000 * 0.012 = $96

3. Compare the profits:
   - Profit from jewelry: $125
   - Profit from electronics: $96

If the sum of their current ages is 162 years, calculate Allen's age 10 years from now.

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Let the current age of Darrel be 7x and the current age of Allen be 11x.
2. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162 years. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   7x + 11x = 162

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \). According to the problem, the number of gold coins is \( S + 30 \). The total number of coins is 110. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:

\[ 2S = 80 \]

Divide by 2:

\[ S = 40 \]

If she can jump 3 miles per hour, how many miles can she travel in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Dana's jumping speed is 3 miles per hour.
2. Her running speed is twice her jumping speed, so her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.
3. Her walking speed is one-fourth of her running speed, so her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.
4. Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.
5. In six hours, one-third of the time is 6 / 3 = 2 hours running.
6. In six hours, two-thirds of the time is 6 * (2/3) = 4 hours walking.
7. Distance covered running: 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles.

Blog articles take an average of 4 hours to research and write. Last week, she wrote 5 articles on Monday and on Tuesday she wrote 2/5 more articles than on Monday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as she wrote on Tuesday. Calculate the total number of hours she spent writing articles on those three days.

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Meredith wrote 5 articles on Monday.
2. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 more articles than on Monday. So, the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday is:
   \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.
3. On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as she wrote on Tuesday. So, the number of articles she wrote on Wednesday is:
   \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.
4. Now, we calculate the total number of articles written over the three days:
   \( 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \) articles.
5. Each article takes 4 hours to write. Therefore, the total number of hours spent writing is:
   \( 26 \times 4 = 104 \) hours.

He spent $200 to buy blue ties that are sold at $40 each. How much money did he spend to buy the ties?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Determine the number of blue ties John bought:
   - Each blue tie costs $40.
   - He spent $200 on blue ties.
   - Number of blue ties = $200 / $40 = 5 blue ties.

2. Determine the number of red ties John bought:
   - He buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   - Number of red ties = 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

3. Determine the price of one red tie:
   - The price of a red tie is 50% more than the price of a blue tie.
   - Price of one blue tie = $40.
   - Price of one red tie = $40 + (50% of $40) = $40 + $20 = $60.

4. Calculate the total cost of the red ties:
   - Number of red ties = 10.
   - Price of one red tie = $60.
   - Total cost of red ties = 10 * $60 = $600.

His fiction books weigh 1/4 pound each and his dolls weigh 1/2 pound each. If he removes 30 fiction books, how many dolls does he need to remove?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. First, calculate the total weight of the 30 fiction books Uriah removes:
   30 books * 1/4 pound per book = 30 * 0.25 = 7.5 pounds.

2. Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds. After removing the books, he still needs to remove:
   15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds.

3. Each doll weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many dolls he needs to remove to make up the remaining 7.5 pounds:
   7.5 pounds / 1/2 pound per doll = 7.5 / 0.5 = 15 dolls.

He realizes that each level of the sandcastle will have half the square feet of the level below it. If he builds a sandcastle with 4 levels where the top level has 16 square feet, what is the average square feet per level?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. The top level has 16 square feet.
2. The level below it will have twice the square feet of the top level, which is 16 * 2 = 32 square feet.
3. The next level below will have twice the square feet of the previous level, which is 32 * 2 = 64 square feet.
4. The bottom level will have twice the square feet of the level above it, which is 64 * 2 = 128 square feet.

Now, we sum the square feet of all levels:
16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet.

To find the average square feet per level, we divide the total square feet by the number of levels:
240 square feet / 4 levels = 60 square feet per level.

If one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, how many bags of dog food will Cecilia use in the first year?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. For the first 180 days, the puppy needs 1 cup of food per day.
   - Total cups for the first 180 days = 180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups.

2. There are 365 days in a year. After the first 180 days, there are 365 - 180 = 185 days remaining in the year.
   - For these 185 days, the puppy needs 2 cups of food per day.
   - Total cups for the remaining 185 days = 185 days * 2 cups/day = 370 cups.

3. Total cups of food needed for the first year = 180 cups + 370 cups = 550 cups.

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's denote the number of games they lost as L. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won is L + 8. The total number of games played is the sum of the games won and lost, which is 22. Therefore, we can write the equation:

L + (L + 8) = 22

Combining like terms, we get:

2L + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides:

2L = 14

Divide both sides by 2:

L = 7

So, the number of games they lost is 7. The number of games they won is:

Step-by-Step Answer:

Translation to English: Question: Leah had 32 chocolates and her sister had 42. If they ate 35, how many pieces do they have left in total?.
Step-by-Step Answer: Leah had 32 chocolates and Leah’s sister had 42. That means there were originally 32 + 42 = 74 chocolates. 35 have been eaten. So in total they still have 74 - 35 = 39 chocolates. The answer is 39.
",John ana maboksi 3. Kila boksi ni la inchi 5 kwa inchi 6 kwa inchi 4. Kuta zina unene wa inchi 1. Jumla ya nafasi ya ndani ya visanduku vyote 3 ni ngapi?,72,"Translation to English: John has 3 boxes. Each box is 5 inches by 6 inches by 4 inches. The walls are 1 inch thick. What is the total internal volume of all 3 boxes?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. First, calculate the internal dimensions of one box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side):
   - Internal length = 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
   - Internal width = 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
   - Internal height = 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

2. Calculate the internal volume of one box:
   - Volume = length × width × height
   - Volume = 3 inches × 4 inches × 2 inches = 24 cubic inches

3. Since there are 3 boxes, multiply the volume of one box by 3:
   - Total internal volume = 24 cubic inches × 3 = 72 cubic inches

If he watched a total of 7 hours of television, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the total hours watched on Monday and Tuesday:
   - Monday: 1 hour
   - Tuesday: 1 hour
   Total for Monday and Tuesday = 1 + 1 = 2 hours

2. Calculate the total hours watched on Thursday:

3. Calculate the total hours watched on Friday:
   - Two 1-hour episodes = 2 hours

4. Add the hours watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:
   - 2 hours (Monday and Tuesday) + 1.5 hours (Thursday) + 2 hours (Friday) = 5.5 hours

5. Subtract the total hours watched on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total hours watched in the week to find the hours watched on Wednesday:

After finishing baking, he realizes he baked 15 more cookies than he expected. 5 cookies fell while he was setting them to cool, and now he has a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.
2. Henry wants to bake twice as many cookies as last year, so he plans to bake \( 2x \) cookies.
3. He ends up baking 15 more cookies than he planned, so he actually bakes \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. 5 cookies fell, so the number of cookies left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \).
5. We know he has a total of 110 cookies now, so we set up the equation: \( 2x + 10 = 110 \).

If he sells them all, how much profit did he make?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the original cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
   - He has 10 boards, each costing $10.
   - Total cost = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

2. Calculate the original cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
   - He has 5 boards, each costing $16.
   - Total cost = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

3. Calculate the total original cost:
   - Total original cost = $100 (for 2 x 4 x 10 boards) + $80 (for 4 x 4 x 10 boards) = $180.

4. Calculate the selling price after a 50% increase:
   - For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 
     - New price per board = $10 + (50% of $10) = $10 + $5 = $15.
     - Total selling price = 10 boards * $15/board = $150.
   - For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
     - New price per board = $16 + (50% of $16) = $16 + $8 = $24.
     - Total selling price = 5 boards * $24/board = $120.

5. Calculate the total selling price:
   - Total selling price = $150 (for 2 x 4 x 10 boards) + $120 (for 4 x 4 x 10 boards) = $270.

Four years later, his salary had increased, and he was earning 40% more than he was earning four years ago. If Adrien's and Lulah's salaries increased proportionally, and Adrien was earning $40,000 four years ago, calculate the total salary that these two people were receiving four years later.

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Four years ago, Adrien's salary was $40,000.
2. Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lulah's salary. Let Lulah's salary be \( L \).
3. Therefore, \( 1.30L = 40000 \).
4. Solving for \( L \), we get \( L = \frac{40000}{1.30} = 30769.23 \) (approximately).

Now, we need to calculate their salaries four years later:
5. Adrien's salary increased by 40%. So, his new salary is \( 40000 \times 1.40 = 56000 \).
6. Since Lulah's salary increased proportionally, we need to find the same proportional increase for Lulah.
7. The proportional increase is the same 40%. So, Lulah's new salary is \( 30769.23 \times 1.40 = 43076.92 \) (approximately).

Finally, we add their new salaries together:

","Mamake Wells huuza tikitimaji, pilipili, na machungwa katika duka lililopo kwenye eneo lake. Bei ya tikitimaji ni mara tatu zaidi ya bei ya kila pilipili. Bei ya tikitimaji imeshinda bei ya chungwa na 5. Dillon ametumwa kwenye duka kununua tikitimaji 4, pilipili 20, na machungwa 10. Atatumia pesa ngapi kwa jumla ikiwa bei ya kila pilipili ni $15?",880,"Translation to English: Question: Wells' mother sells watermelons, peppers, and oranges in a shop located in her area. The price of a watermelon is three times the price of each pepper. The price of a watermelon exceeds the price of an orange by 5. Dillon is sent to the shop to buy 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. How much money will he spend in total if the price of each pepper is $15?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Determine the price of each pepper: $15.
2. Calculate the price of a watermelon: 3 times the price of a pepper.
   Price of a watermelon = 3 * $15 = $45.
3. Determine the price of an orange: The price of a watermelon exceeds the price of an orange by 5.
   Let the price of an orange be x.
   $45 = x + 5
   x = $45 - $5
   x = $40
   Therefore, the price of an orange is $40.
4. Calculate the total cost for 4 watermelons:
   4 watermelons * $45 per watermelon = $180.
5. Calculate the total cost for 20 peppers:
   20 peppers * $15 per pepper = $300.
6. Calculate the total cost for 10 oranges:
   10 oranges * $40 per orange = $400.
7. Add the total costs together:
   $180 (watermelons) + $300 (peppers) + $400 (oranges) = $880.

Doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour and the hospital charges patients $200 per hour. How much profit does the hospital make from these visits?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Each patient is attended to for 24 minutes. To convert this to hours, we use the conversion factor: 24 minutes = 24/60 hours = 0.4 hours.
2. The hospital serves 500 patients per day. Therefore, the total hours spent on all patients per day is 500 patients * 0.4 hours/patient = 200 hours.
3. The hospital charges patients $200 per hour. Therefore, the total revenue from patients per day is 200 hours * $200/hour = $40,000.
4. The doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour. Therefore, the total cost paid to doctors per day is 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.

First, we need to determine the number of semi-automatic cars. We know there are 20 cars in total, with 12 being automatic and 4 being manual. 

So, the number of semi-automatic cars is:
20 - 12 - 4 = 4 cars.

Next, we calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars out of the total number of cars. The formula for percentage is:

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the total number of customers: 3 current customers + 5 potential customers = 8 customers.
2. Calculate the total cost of chlorine bottles: Each customer needs 2 bottles, so 8 customers need 8 * 2 = 16 bottles. Each bottle costs $2, so the total cost for chlorine is 16 * $2 = $32.
3. Calculate the total cost of cleaning cloth packages: Each customer needs 1 package, so 8 customers need 8 packages. Each package costs $5, so the total cost for cloths is 8 * $5 = $40.
4. Calculate the total operating costs: $32 (chlorine) + $40 (cloths) = $72.

If Tim can use his skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner wait at home before the loser arrives home?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. First, convert the distances from miles to feet. There are 5280 feet in a mile.
   - Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet.
   - Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet.

2. Calculate the time it takes for each to get home.
   - Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet per minute = 36 minutes.

They decided to compete on a football field that is 100 yards long. Blake runs back and forth 15 times. Kelly runs back and forth once, and then decides she doesn't want to run alongside Blake, so she starts running to the 40-yard line back and forth. She does this 34 times. How much farther did the winner run than the loser?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the total distance Blake ran:
   - Blake runs back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field.
   - Each back and forth is 2 * 100 = 200 yards.
   - Total distance for Blake: 15 * 200 = 3000 yards.

2. Calculate the total distance Kelly ran:
   - Kelly runs back and forth once on a 100-yard field.
   - Each back and forth is 2 * 100 = 200 yards.
   - Then Kelly runs back and forth 34 times to the 40-yard line.
   - Each back and forth to the 40-yard line is 2 * 40 = 80 yards.
   - Total distance for Kelly: 200 + (34 * 80) = 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

3. Determine the difference in distance:
   - Blake ran 3000 yards.
   - Kelly ran 2920 yards.
   - Difference: 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Let Brooke's current age be B years.
2. Seth's current age is 2B years (since Seth's age is twice Brooke's age).
3. In 2 years, Brooke's age will be B + 2 years.
4. In 2 years, Seth's age will be 2B + 2 years.
5. The sum of their ages in 2 years will be (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28.
6. Simplify the equation: B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28.
7. Combine like terms: 3B + 4 = 28.
8. Subtract 4 from both sides: 3B = 24.

","Kuna ndege wanne katika Caboose. Sally Two ana umri wa miaka mitatu zaidi ya Granny Red. Umri wa Granny Red ni mara mbili zaidi ya umri wa Sally Four. Ikiwa Sally Four ana umri sawa na Sally Thirtytwo, na Sally Thirtytwo ana umri wa miaka 8, jumla ya umri wa ndege hawa wanne ni ngapi?",51,"Translation to English: Question: There are four birds in Caboose. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Granny Red's age is twice the age of Sally Four. If Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, and Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, what is the total age of these four birds?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
2. Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red's age is twice the age of Sally Four. Since Sally Four is 8 years old, Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.
4. Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Since Granny Red is 16 years old, Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, we sum the ages of the four birds:
- Sally Two: 19 years
- Granny Red: 16 years
- Sally Four: 8 years
- Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years

Total age = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51 years.

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the total minimum monthly payment:

It takes Billy one and a half minutes to peel a potato, but only 5 seconds to cut it. How long will it take Billy to finish preparing the potatoes?

1. Each gallon costs $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, so the total cost per gallon is $3 + $2 = $5.
2. Each gallon holds 20 glasses, and they sell each glass for $0.50. Therefore, the revenue from one gallon is 20 * $0.50 = $10.
3. The profit from one gallon is the revenue minus the cost, which is $10 - $5 = $5.
4. They made a total profit of $25. Since the profit per gallon is $5, the number of gallons they sold is $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

3. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time.

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the total time for the faster team:
   - Each runner runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
   - There are 4 runners.
   - Total time for the faster team = 4 * 55 = 220 seconds.

2. Calculate the total time for the slower team:
   - The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds.
   - The second runner runs 400 meters in 60 + 3 = 63 seconds.
   - The third runner runs 400 meters in 63 + 3 = 66 seconds.
   - The fourth runner runs 400 meters in 66 + 3 = 69 seconds.
   - Total time for the slower team = 60 + 63 + 66 + 69 = 258 seconds.

What is the highest probability (in percentage) that he will roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling a number two twice in a row?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 such numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.
   Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

2. Next, let's determine the probability of rolling a 2 twice in a row. The probability of rolling a 2 on a single roll is 1/6.
   Probability of rolling a 2 twice in a row = (1/6) * (1/6) = 1/36 ≈ 0.0278 or 2.78%.

3. Now, we compare the two probabilities:
   - Probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 50%
   - Probability of rolling a 2 twice in a row: 2.78%

4. The highest probability is the one for rolling a number greater than 3, which is 50%.

Mice are placed in 3 cages in equal groups and each mouse is given 6 pieces of tube. There are 10 cages of hamsters which are placed individually and each hamster is given 5 tubes. There is also a group of rabbits where 20 pieces of tube are shared among the rabbits. No tubes were used elsewhere in the store. If 160 pieces of tube were distributed among the rodents, how many mice are in each cage?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Let's denote the number of mice in each cage as \( x \).
2. Each mouse gets 6 pieces of tube, and there are 3 cages. Therefore, the total number of tubes given to the mice is \( 3 \times 6x = 18x \).
3. There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 tubes. Therefore, the total number of tubes given to the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).
4. The rabbits share 20 pieces of tube.
5. The total number of tubes distributed is 160.

We can set up the equation:
\[ 18x + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

6. Simplify the equation:
\[ 18x + 70 = 160 \]

7. Subtract 70 from both sides:
\[ 18x = 90 \]

8. Divide both sides by 18:
\[ x = 5 \]

2. The monthly interest rate is 2%, which means each month the amount increases by 2% of the current amount.
3. After the first month, the amount owed is $100 + (2/100 * $100) = $100 + $2 = $102.

They also bought food and the ticket price was $4.50 more than the food price. They also went on 2 different trips costing $33 each. If they agreed to split all costs equally, how much did each of them pay?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the total cost of the tickets: $20.25.
2. Let the cost of the food be \( x \). The cost of the tickets is $4.50 more than the cost of the food, so \( x + 4.50 = 20.25 \).
3. Solve for \( x \): 
   \[
   x + 4.50 = 20.25 \implies x = 20.25 - 4.50 \implies x = 15.75
   \]
   Therefore, the cost of the food is $15.75.
4. Calculate the total cost of the trips: 2 trips at $33 each:
   \[
   2 \times 33 = 66
   \]
5. Calculate the total cost of everything:
   \[
   20.25 \text{ (tickets)} + 15.75 \text{ (food)} + 66 \text{ (trips)} = 102
   \]
6. Since the total cost is $102 and it is split equally among 3 friends:
   \[
   \frac{102}{3} = 34
   \]
   Therefore, each friend paid $34.

Then, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. By Sunday afternoon, how many more pink flamingos were there than white ones?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.
2. On Saturday morning, one-third of the flamingos were removed and painted white. One-third of 18 is \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \). So, 6 flamingos were painted white.

If his weekly salary is $2000 and he received the award on the first day of the year, how much money did he make in total that year?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the initial annual salary before the raise:
   - Weekly salary = $2000
   - Number of weeks in a year = 52
   - Initial annual salary = $2000 * 52 = $104,000

2. Calculate the new weekly salary after the 5% raise:
   - 5% of $2000 = 0.05 * $2000 = $100
   - New weekly salary = $2000 + $100 = $2100

3. Calculate the new annual salary after the raise:
   - New annual salary = $2100 * 52 = $109,200

He prepared a large macaroni and cheese meal to last several dinners that week and used 8 slices of cheese in that meal. How many slices of cheese did he use in total?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, which means he ate 7 sandwiches in a week (since there are 7 days in a week). Each sandwich had 2 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese for sandwiches: 7 days * 2 slices/day = 14 slices.

2. Carl ate omelets for breakfast on 3 days, and each omelet had one more slice of cheese than his sandwich. Since each sandwich had 2 slices, each omelet had 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese.
   - Total cheese for omelets: 3 days * 3 slices/day = 9 slices.

3. Carl used 8 slices of cheese for the large macaroni and cheese meal.
   - Total cheese for macaroni and cheese: 8 slices.

4. Adding all the slices together:
   - Total slices of cheese = 14 (sandwiches) + 9 (omelets) + 8 (macaroni and cheese) = 31 slices.

Mr. Bert gives six assignments each term. He allows students to drop the lowest score from their average each term. If Brinley has scores of 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 for the first five assignments, what score does she need on the sixth assignment to have an average of 93?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. To find the required score for the sixth assignment, we first need to calculate the total score needed for an average of 93 after dropping the lowest score.
2. Since there are 6 assignments and the lowest score will be dropped, the average will be calculated from the best 5 scores.
3. The total score needed for an average of 93 from 5 assignments is \( 93 \times 5 = 465 \).

4. Brinley's current scores are 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. The lowest score among these is 71.
5. The sum of the highest 4 scores (excluding 71) is \( 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367 \).

6. To find the score needed on the sixth assignment, we set up the equation:
\[ 367 + x = 465 \]
where \( x \) is the score needed on the sixth assignment.

\[ x = 465 - 367 \]

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. For the first four weeks:
   - Michael rode 5 times a week.
   - Each ride was 25 kilometers.
   - Total distance per week = 5 rides/week * 25 kilometers/ride = 125 kilometers/week.

   - Each ride was 60 kilometers.
   - Total distance per week = 2 rides/week * 60 kilometers/ride = 120 kilometers/week.

Calculate the total price of each cup.

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. First, calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each.
   - Half a dozen plates = 6 plates.
   - Total cost of 6 plates = 6 * $6000 = $36000.

2. The price of twenty dozen cups is $1200 less than $36000.
   - Total cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

3. Calculate the total number of cups in twenty dozen.
   - One dozen = 12 cups.
   - Twenty dozen = 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

4. Calculate the price of each cup.

Red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, and white chickens produce 5 eggs per day. Every day Jerry collects 42 eggs. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Let the number of red chickens be \( R \).
2. Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is \( R + 2 \).
3. Red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, so the total eggs from red chickens per day is \( 3R \).
4. White chickens produce 5 eggs per day, so the total eggs from white chickens per day is \( 5(R + 2) \).
5. The total number of eggs collected per day is 42, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   3R + 5(R + 2) = 42
   \]
6. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   3R + 5R + 10 = 42
   \]
   \[
   8R + 10 = 42

1. First, calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is \( P = 2 \times (length + width) \).
2. Here, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles. So, the perimeter \( P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \) miles.
3. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour.

Four minutes ago, the large pool had twice the amount of water in the small pool. Now the large pool has four times the water in the small pool. How much water does the small pool have now?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Let \( S \) be the amount of water in the small pool now.
2. Let \( L \) be the amount of water in the large pool now.
3. According to the problem, \( L = 4S \).

4. Four minutes ago, both pools had more water. Since they are leaking at 4 gallons per minute, each pool has lost \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons in the last 4 minutes.

","Janeth alikopesha $2000 na akaahidi kurudisha na ziada ya 10% ya kiwango hicho. Ikiwa atakuwa akilipa $165 kila mwezi kwa miezi 12, salio la Janeth linalosalia kufikia wakati huo litakuwa ngapi?",220,"Translation to English: Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of that amount. If she will be paying $165 every month for 12 months, what will be Janeth's remaining balance at that time?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Calculate the total amount Janeth needs to repay, including the 10% interest.
   - 10% of $2000 is $2000 * 0.10 = $200.

If he loses 8 water types and buys 14 grass types, what is the percentage chance of randomly picking a water type card (rounded to the nearest whole number)?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. James initially has 30 fire types, 20 grass types, and 40 water types.
2. He loses 8 water types, so the number of water types left is 40 - 8 = 32.
3. He buys 14 more grass types, so the number of grass types becomes 20 + 14 = 34.
4. The total number of cards now is 30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96.
5. The probability of picking a water type card is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, which is 32 / 96.
6. To find the percentage, we multiply by 100: (32 / 96) * 100 = 33.33.

If after the meeting 30% of the students left the building through door A, 3/5 of the remaining students left through door B, and the rest left through door C, calculate the number of students who left through door C.

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Total number of students = 1000.
2. 30% of the students left through door A.

The difference in the number of snails in these two fish tanks is twice the number of fish in both fish tanks.

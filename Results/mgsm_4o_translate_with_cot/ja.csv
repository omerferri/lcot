He bought a house for $80,000 and spent $50,000 on repairs. As a result, the house's price increased by 150%. What is Josh's profit?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the total initial investment by adding the purchase price and the repair costs:
   $80,000 (purchase price) + $50,000 (repair costs) = $130,000 (total investment).

2. Determine the new value of the house after a 150% increase:
   A 150% increase means the house's value is now 250% of the original purchase price (100% original price + 150% increase).
   New value = 250% of $80,000 = 2.5 * $80,000 = $200,000.

3. Calculate the profit by subtracting the total investment from the new value of the house:
   Profit = $200,000 (new value) - $130,000 (total investment) = $70,000.

Step-by-Step Answer: Leah had 32 chocolates and Leah’s sister had 42. That means there were originally 32 + 42 = 74 chocolates. 35 have been eaten. So in total they still have 74 - 35 = 39 chocolates. The answer is 39.
",ジョンは時速60マイルで3時間車を運転した後に、自宅に非常に大事なものを忘れたことに気づいたため引き返します。4時間以内に自宅に戻ろうとしますが、最初の2時間は大渋滞で動けません。次の30分間を時速30マイルで運転し、その後時速80マイルで自宅に向かいました。4時間が経過したタイミングで、ジョンは自宅から何マイル離れていることになりますか？,45,"Translation to English: John drove for 3 hours at 60 miles per hour and then realized he forgot something very important at home, so he turned back. He wants to return home within 4 hours, but for the first 2 hours, he is stuck in heavy traffic and cannot move. He then drives for the next 30 minutes at 30 miles per hour, and after that, he drives at 80 miles per hour towards home. How many miles away from home will John be at the 4-hour mark?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the distance John initially drove away from home:
   - He drove for 3 hours at 60 miles per hour.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 60 miles/hour × 3 hours = 180 miles.

2. Calculate the time he has left to return home after realizing he forgot something:
   - He wants to return home within 4 hours.
   - He has already driven for 3 hours.
   - Time left = 4 hours - 3 hours = 1 hour.

3. Calculate the distance he covers in the first 2 hours of being stuck in traffic:
   - He is stuck in traffic for 2 hours and does not move.
   - Distance covered = 0 miles.

4. Calculate the distance he covers in the next 30 minutes at 30 miles per hour:
   - 30 minutes is 0.5 hours.
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 0.5 hours = 15 miles.

5. Calculate the time left after the 2 hours of traffic and 30 minutes of driving:
   - Total time spent so far = 2 hours (traffic) + 0.5 hours (driving) = 2.5 hours.
   - Time left = 4 hours - 2.5 hours = 1.5 hours.

6. Calculate the distance he covers in the remaining 1.5 hours at 80 miles per hour:
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 80 miles/hour × 1.5 hours = 120 miles.

7. Calculate the total distance he has driven back towards home:
   - Total distance driven back = 15 miles (first 30 minutes) + 120 miles (next 1.5 hours) = 135 miles.

8. Calculate how far he is from home at the 4-hour mark:
   - He initially drove 180 miles away from home.
   - He has driven 135 miles back towards home.
   - Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles.

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the annual revenue from the lemons:

3. Calculate the net annual profit:
   - Net annual profit = Annual revenue - Annual maintenance cost.
   - Net annual profit = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

4. Determine the initial investment:
   - Initial investment = $90.

She sold one-third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 at the red house, and half of the remaining at the orange house. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, how many did she have at the start of her sales?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Let \( x \) be the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie had at the start.
2. She sold one-third of \( x \) at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) there.
3. She sold 2 vacuum cleaners at the red house.
4. After selling at the green and red houses, she had \( x - \left(\frac{x}{3} + 2\right) \) vacuum cleaners left.
5. She then sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners at the orange house, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( x - \left(\frac{x}{3} + 2\right) \right) \).
6. After all these sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left.

We can set up the equation:
\[ x - \left(\frac{x}{3} + 2\right) - \frac{1}{2} \left( x - \left(\frac{x}{3} + 2\right) \right) = 5 \]

Simplify the equation step-by-step:
\[ x - \left(\frac{x}{3} + 2\right) = \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \]
\[ \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = \frac{x}{3} - 1 \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ x - \left(\frac{x}{3} + 2\right) - \left(\frac{x}{3} - 1\right) = 5 \]
\[ x - \frac{x}{3} - 2 - \frac{x}{3} + 1 = 5 \]
\[ x - \frac{2x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{3x}{3} - \frac{2x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} - 1 = 5 \]
\[ \frac{x}{3} = 6 \]
\[ x = 18 \]

","ある商人が、5,000ドルの宝石と8,000ドルの電化製品という2つの仕入れ計画から1つを選択しようとしています。商人の金融アドバイザーの推測によれば、今後同じ月の間に、宝石の価格は2.5%、電化製品の価格は1.2%上昇します。この月の終わりに利益を最大化できるよう仕入れ計画を選択するとすると、その利益はいくらになりますか？",125,"Translation to English: A merchant is choosing between two procurement plans: one for $5,000 worth of jewelry and another for $8,000 worth of electronics. According to the merchant's financial advisor, the price of jewelry will increase by 2.5% and the price of electronics will increase by 1.2% during the same month. If the merchant wants to maximize profit by the end of the month, what will the profit be?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the increase in the price of jewelry:
   - Initial price of jewelry: $5,000
   - Percentage increase: 2.5%
   - Increase in price: $5,000 * 0.025 = $125

2. Calculate the increase in the price of electronics:
   - Initial price of electronics: $8,000
   - Percentage increase: 1.2%
   - Increase in price: $8,000 * 0.012 = $96

3. Compare the increases to determine which plan maximizes profit:
   - Increase in jewelry price: $125
   - Increase in electronics price: $96

Since the increase in the price of jewelry ($125) is greater than the increase in the price of electronics ($96), the merchant should choose the jewelry procurement plan to maximize profit.

Step-by-Step Answer: Let the original price of the book be \( P \).

Since Kyle bought the book at 25% less than the original price, he paid 75% of the original price.

This can be written as:

If she can skip at a speed of 3 miles per hour, how many kilometers can she travel in 6 hours if she runs for one-third of the time and walks for two-thirds of the time?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Determine Dana's running speed:
   - Skipping speed = 3 miles per hour
   - Running speed = 2 * Skipping speed = 2 * 3 = 6 miles per hour

2. Determine Dana's walking speed:
   - Running speed = 6 miles per hour
   - Walking speed = Running speed / 4 = 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour

3. Calculate the time spent running and walking in 6 hours:
   - Total time = 6 hours
   - Time running = (1/3) * 6 = 2 hours
   - Time walking = (2/3) * 6 = 4 hours

4. Calculate the distance covered while running:
   - Distance running = Running speed * Time running = 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = 12 miles

If your daily calorie goal is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories, how many grams of a 300-gram bag of potato chips with 5 servings can you eat?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. First, determine how many calories you have left to consume for the day:
   2000 (daily calorie goal) - 1800 (calories already consumed) = 200 calories remaining.

2. Next, find out how many calories are in one serving of the potato chips:
   One serving = 250 calories.

3. Calculate the number of servings you can consume with the remaining 200 calories:
   200 calories / 250 calories per serving = 0.8 servings.

4. Now, determine the weight of one serving in grams:
   The total weight of the bag is 300 grams, and it contains 5 servings.
   Therefore, one serving = 300 grams / 5 servings = 60 grams.

If he sells each candle for $2.00, what is the net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Determine how many pounds of beeswax are needed to make 20 candles. Since 1 pound of beeswax makes 10 candles, 20 candles will require 20 / 10 = 2 pounds of beeswax.
2. Calculate the total cost of supplies for 2 pounds of beeswax. The cost per pound is $10.00, so for 2 pounds, the cost is 2 * $10.00 = $20.00.
3. Calculate the total revenue from selling 20 candles. Each candle sells for $2.00, so the revenue is 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

If she had 23 Post-it notes left, how many Post-it notes were in the pack she bought?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes.
2. She bought an additional pack of Post-it notes, which we need to determine the quantity of.
3. At work, she used 220 Post-it notes.
4. After using the Post-it notes, she had 23 left.

Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the pack she bought as \( x \).

The total number of Post-it notes she had after buying the pack is:
\[ 80 + x \]

She used 220 Post-it notes, so the number of Post-it notes left after using them is:
\[ (80 + x) - 220 \]

We know she had 23 Post-it notes left, so:
\[ (80 + x) - 220 = 23 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

\[ x = 23 + 140 \]

   - Number of blue ties = $200 / $40 per tie = 5 blue ties.

2. Determine the number of red ties John bought:
   - He buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   - Number of red ties = 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

3. Determine the cost of each red tie:
   - Red ties are 50% more expensive than blue ties.
   - Cost of each blue tie = $40.
   - Cost of each red tie = $40 + (50% of $40) = $40 + $20 = $60.

4. Calculate the total cost of the red ties:
   - Number of red ties = 10.
   - Cost of each red tie = $60.
   - Total cost of red ties = 10 * $60 = $600.

5. Calculate the total amount spent on all ties:
   - Total cost of blue ties = $200.
   - Total cost of red ties = $600.
   - Total amount spent = $200 + $600 = $800.

A delivery truck is carrying 33 identical boxes, each weighing 15 pounds, and is attempting to cross the bridge. The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds. What is the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Determine the total weight limit of the bridge: 5000 pounds.
2. Determine the weight of the driver and the empty truck: 3755 pounds.
3. Calculate the remaining weight capacity for the boxes: 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds.
4. Determine the weight of one box: 15 pounds.
5. Calculate the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded without exceeding the weight limit: 1245 / 15 = 83 boxes.

Since the truck is already carrying 33 boxes, we need to check if this number is within the limit:
- Weight of 33 boxes: 33 * 15 = 495 pounds.
- Total weight with 33 boxes: 3755 + 495 = 4250 pounds.

Since 4250 pounds is less than 5000 pounds, the truck can carry 33 boxes without exceeding the weight limit. However, the question asks for the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded.

To find the maximum number of boxes:
- Maximum number of boxes: 1245 / 15 = 83 boxes.

Therefore, the truck can carry up to 83 boxes without exceeding the bridge's weight limit.

3. Number of green oranges = 20% of 25 = 0.20 * 25 = 5
4. Number of sour oranges = 2

To find the number of oranges in good condition, we subtract the number of spoiled, green, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges:
Number of good condition oranges = Total oranges - (Spoiled oranges + Green oranges + Sour oranges)

He eventually notices that each layer of the sandcastle is half the size of the layer below it. If he builds a 4-layer sandcastle and the top layer is 16 square feet, what is the average size of each layer?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. The top layer (4th layer) is 16 square feet.
2. The 3rd layer is twice the size of the 4th layer: 16 * 2 = 32 square feet.
3. The 2nd layer is twice the size of the 3rd layer: 32 * 2 = 64 square feet.
4. The 1st layer is twice the size of the 2nd layer: 64 * 2 = 128 square feet.

Now, we need to find the average size of these four layers:
- Sum of the areas of all layers: 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet.

After that, she needs to feed the dog 2 cups of dog food for the remaining period of the dog's first year. If one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, how many bags of dog food does Cecilia need for the first year?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the total amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days:
   - 1 cup per day for 180 days = 1 * 180 = 180 cups.

2. Calculate the number of days remaining in the first year after the initial 180 days:
   - A year has 365 days, so the remaining days are 365 - 180 = 185 days.

3. Calculate the total amount of dog food needed for the remaining 185 days:
   - 2 cups per day for 185 days = 2 * 185 = 370 cups.

4. Calculate the total amount of dog food needed for the entire first year:
   - Total cups = 180 cups (first 180 days) + 370 cups (remaining 185 days) = 180 + 370 = 550 cups.

5. Determine how many bags of dog food are needed:
   - Each bag contains 110 cups.
   - Number of bags needed = 550 cups / 110 cups per bag = 5 bags.

2. They won 8 more matches than they lost, so the number of matches they won is \( L + 8 \).
3. The total number of matches played is the sum of matches won and lost: \( L + (L + 8) = 22 \).
4. Simplify the equation: \( 2L + 8 = 22 \).
5. Subtract 8 from both sides: \( 2L = 14 \).

The company has a policy of increasing the salary of employees who have been with the company for 5 years by 10% of the initial salary each year. If Sylvie completed her 5th year with the company last December, what will her annual salary be after working for another 3 years?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600.
2. Her initial annual salary is $600 * 12 = $7,200.
3. After completing 5 years, her salary increases by 10% each year.

Let's calculate her salary for each of the next 3 years:
- After 1 year (6th year): $7,200 + 10% of $7,200 = $7,200 + $720 = $7,920.
- After 2 years (7th year): $7,920 + 10% of $7,920 = $7,920 + $792 = $8,712.
- After 3 years (8th year): $8,712 + 10% of $8,712 = $8,712 + $871.20 = $9,583.20.

",クリスティーナは誕生日会を計画しており、4分の1の出席者は参加しないので、各招待客につき.75個のギフトバッグが必要です。彼女は16人の友人を招待しました。ギフトバッグはそれぞれ$2です。彼女はいくら使うことになりますか？,24,"Translation to English: Christina is planning a birthday party, and a quarter of the attendees will not participate, so she needs 0.75 gift bags per invitee. She invited 16 friends. Each gift bag costs $2. How much will she spend?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Christina invited 16 friends.
2. A quarter of the attendees will not participate, so the number of attendees is \( \frac{3}{4} \) of 16.
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 16 = 12

   So, 12 friends will attend the party.
3. Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per attendee.
   \[
   12 \times 0.75 = 9

",フリーダがトマトの缶詰でソースを作ると、そのボリュームが半分減る。彼女が使うそれぞれ16オンスのトマト缶には3つのトマトが入っている。トマトソースの最後のバッチには32オンス入っていた。フリーダはトマトをいくつ使った？,12,"Translation to English: Question: When Frida makes sauce from canned tomatoes, the volume is reduced by half. Each 16-ounce can of tomatoes she uses contains 3 tomatoes. The final batch of tomato sauce had 32 ounces. How many tomatoes did Frida use?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. The final batch of tomato sauce had 32 ounces.
2. Since the volume is reduced by half when making the sauce, the original volume of tomatoes used must have been 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.
3. Each can of tomatoes is 16 ounces. Therefore, the number of cans used is 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.
4. Each can contains 3 tomatoes. Therefore, the total number of tomatoes used is 4 cans * 3 tomatoes per can = 12 tomatoes.

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. First, calculate the internal dimensions of one box. Since the wall thickness is 1 inch, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side):
   - Internal length = 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
   - Internal width = 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
   - Internal height = 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

2. Calculate the volume of the contents of one box using the internal dimensions:
   - Volume of one box = 3 inches * 4 inches * 2 inches = 24 cubic inches

3. Since John has 3 boxes, calculate the total volume of the contents of all 3 boxes:

If he watched TV for a total of 7 hours, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the total time Frankie watched TV on each day except Wednesday:

While cooling the cookies, he removes 5 of them, and now he has a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry bake last year?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry baked last year.
2. This year, he wants to bake \( 2x \) cookies.
3. He actually baked \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. He removed 5 cookies, so the number of cookies left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \).
5. We know that the number of cookies left is 110.
6. Therefore, we set up the equation: \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \).
7. Simplify the equation: \( 2x + 10 = 110 \).

For every 10 feet she rowed towards the shore, 2 liters of water entered the boat. The shore was 64 feet away. How much water entered the boat by the time Julia reached the shore?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Julia needs to row 64 feet to reach the shore.
2. For every 10 feet she rows, 2 liters of water enter the boat.
3. To find out how many 10-foot segments are in 64 feet, we divide 64 by 10: 
   \[
   64 \div 10 = 6.4
   \]
4. Since water enters the boat for every 10 feet rowed, we need to consider the full segments and the partial segment:
   - For 6 full segments (each 10 feet), 2 liters of water enter per segment:
     \[
     6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ liters}
     \]
   - For the remaining 4 feet (0.4 of a 10-foot segment), the water entering is proportional:
     \[
     0.4 \times 2 = 0.8 \text{ liters}
     \]
5. Adding the water from the full segments and the partial segment:

The maximum number of photos Brittany's phone can store is 50 times the number of ducks in the photos Jamal took at the zoo. If Jamal's phone can store 1800 photos, how many ducks are in the photos Jamal took at the zoo?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Let \( B \) be the maximum number of photos Brittany's phone can store.
2. Let \( D \) be the number of ducks in the photos Jamal took at the zoo.
3. Jamal's phone can store 6 times as many photos as Brittany's phone, so \( J = 6B \).
4. We know that Jamal's phone can store 1800 photos, so \( J = 1800 \).
5. Therefore, \( 1800 = 6B \).
6. Solving for \( B \), we get \( B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \).
7. Brittany's phone can store 50 times the number of ducks in the photos Jamal took, so \( B = 50D \).

She decided to sell the remaining lumber. She has ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards, each costing $10. She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards, each costing $16. If she sells everything, how much profit will she make?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the new price of each type of board after the 50% increase.
   - For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards: $10 + 50% of $10 = $10 + $5 = $15 per board.
   - For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards: $16 + 50% of $16 = $16 + $8 = $24 per board.

2. Calculate the total selling price for each type of board.
   - For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 10 boards * $15 per board = $150.
   - For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 5 boards * $24 per board = $120.

3. Calculate the total cost price for each type of board.
   - For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards: 10 boards * $10 per board = $100.
   - For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards: 5 boards * $16 per board = $80.

4. Calculate the total selling price and total cost price.
   - Total selling price: $150 + $120 = $270.
   - Total cost price: $100 + $80 = $180.

5. Calculate the profit.
   - Profit = Total selling price - Total cost price = $270 - $180 = $90.

Step-by-Step Answer: The ratio of sugar to water is 7:13. This means for every 20 parts (7 parts sugar + 13 parts water), 7 parts are sugar.

First, we need to find out how many parts are in 120 teaspoons:
Total parts = 7 (sugar) + 13 (water) = 20 parts.

Next, we calculate how many sets of 20 parts are in 120 teaspoons:
Number of sets = 120 / 20 = 6 sets.

Since each set contains 7 parts of sugar, we multiply the number of sets by the parts of sugar:
Sugar used = 7 parts/set * 6 sets = 42 teaspoons.

If both Adrian and Lilia's salaries increased at the same time, and Adrian was earning $40,000 four years ago, what is the total salary they will receive four years later?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Adrian's salary four years ago was $40,000.
2. Adrian's salary increased by 40% over four years. Therefore, his new salary is:
   \[
   40,000 + (40,000 \times 0.40) = 40,000 + 16,000 = 56,000

3. Adrian's salary is 30% higher than Lilia's salary. Let Lilia's salary four years ago be \( x \).
   \[
   40,000 = x + (x \times 0.30) = x \times 1.30
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \approx 30,769.23

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. On Monday, Sadie slept for 8 hours.

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Rosie runs at 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. The distance she covers in this time is:
   \( 10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles} \).

2. Then, she runs at 5 miles per hour for 1 hour. The distance she covers in this time is:
   \( 5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 5 \text{ miles} \).

3. Adding these distances together, the total distance she runs in the first 4 hours is:
   \( 30 \text{ miles} + 5 \text{ miles} = 35 \text{ miles} \).

4. Since the question asks for the distance she can run in 7 hours, and we only have information for the first 4 hours, we need to assume she continues running at the same speed of 5 miles per hour for the remaining 3 hours.

5. The distance she covers in the remaining 3 hours at 5 miles per hour is:
   \( 5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ miles} \).

6. Adding this to the previous total, the total distance she runs in 7 hours is:

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Jenny has 60 letters that need stamps.
2. She puts stamps on one-third of these letters.
3. One-third of 60 is calculated as \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \).
4. Therefore, Jenny puts stamps on 20 letters.
5. After putting stamps on these 20 letters, the pile of letters that already have stamps now has 30 letters.
6. To find out how many letters were originally in the pile that already had stamps, we subtract the 20 letters Jenny added from the current total of 30 letters.

The price of a watermelon is three times the price of a chili pepper. An orange is $5 cheaper than a watermelon. Dillon sent 4 watermelons, 20 chili peppers, and 10 oranges to the store. If one chili pepper costs $15, how much is the total cost?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Determine the price of one watermelon:
   - The price of one chili pepper is $15.
   - The price of one watermelon is 3 times the price of one chili pepper.
   - Therefore, the price of one watermelon is 3 * $15 = $45.

2. Determine the price of one orange:
   - An orange is $5 cheaper than a watermelon.
   - Therefore, the price of one orange is $45 - $5 = $40.

3. Calculate the total cost for 4 watermelons:
   - The price of one watermelon is $45.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 4 watermelons is 4 * $45 = $180.

4. Calculate the total cost for 20 chili peppers:
   - The price of one chili pepper is $15.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 20 chili peppers is 20 * $15 = $300.

Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. Doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour. The hospital charges patients $200 per hour. How much revenue does the hospital earn from these consultations?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the total consultation time for all patients in a day:
   - Each patient is seen for 24 minutes.
   - There are 500 patients.
   - Total consultation time = 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12000 minutes.

2. Convert the total consultation time from minutes to hours:
   - 12000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours.

3. Calculate the total revenue the hospital earns from patients:
   - The hospital charges $200 per hour.
   - Total revenue from patients = 200 hours * $200/hour = $40000.

4. Calculate the total cost the hospital pays to doctors:
   - Doctors charge $150 per hour.
   - Total cost to doctors = 200 hours * $150/hour = $30000.

5. Calculate the net revenue the hospital earns:

On Tuesday, he walked 6 times the miles he walked on Monday. The total distance he walked from Monday to Wednesday was 41 miles. How many miles did he walk on Wednesday?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
2. On Tuesday, he walked 6 times the miles he walked on Monday. So, on Tuesday, he walked 4 * 6 = 24 miles.
3. The total distance he walked from Monday to Wednesday was 41 miles.
4. Let \( W \) be the number of miles he walked on Wednesday.
5. The total distance walked from Monday to Wednesday is the sum of the distances walked on each day: 4 (Monday) + 24 (Tuesday) + \( W \) (Wednesday) = 41 miles.
6. Therefore, \( 4 + 24 + W = 41 \).
7. Simplifying, \( 28 + W = 41 \).

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Let \( Q \) be the number of queen bees.
2. The number of baby bees is \( 2Q \) (since there are twice as many baby bees as queen bees).
3. The number of worker bees is \( 12 \times 2Q = 24Q \) (since there are 12 times as many worker bees as baby bees).
4. The total number of bees is the sum of queen bees, baby bees, and worker bees: \( Q + 2Q + 24Q = 27Q \).
5. We know the total number of bees is 700, so \( 27Q = 700 \).
6. Solving for \( Q \), we get \( Q = \frac{700}{27} \approx 25.93 \).

Since the number of bees must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate the problem for a possible mistake in the interpretation or calculation. However, if we assume the problem allows for non-integer values, we proceed with the calculation:

7. The number of worker bees is \( 24Q = 24 \times 25.93 \approx 622.32 \).

After that, the bees that initially left but have not yet returned come back to the hive in the next 6 hours. How many bees does Deborah see returning to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. In the first 6 hours, 30 bees leave the hive.
2. Half of these 30 bees return within the first 6 hours. So, \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees return.
3. This means \( 30 - 15 = 15 \) bees have not yet returned after the first 6 hours.

Step-by-Step Answer: Leah had 32 chocolates and Leah’s sister had 42. That means there were originally 32 + 42 = 74 chocolates. 35 have been eaten. So in total they still have 74 - 35 = 39 chocolates. The answer is 39.

The seagull landed and devoured half of the fries Dave had eaten. Then, three pigeons took food from him, each eating 3 fries. Later, a raccoon took two-thirds of the remaining fries. An ant carried away the last fry, leaving 5. How many fries were in the pack when Dave bought it?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Dave ate 14 fries initially.
2. The seagull ate half of the fries Dave had eaten, which is 14 / 2 = 7 fries.
3. So, the total fries eaten by Dave and the seagull is 14 + 7 = 21 fries.
4. Three pigeons each ate 3 fries, so they ate a total of 3 * 3 = 9 fries.
5. Adding the fries eaten by the pigeons to the previous total, we get 21 + 9 = 30 fries.
6. Let \( x \) be the total number of fries in the pack initially. After the seagull and pigeons, the remaining fries are \( x - 30 \).
7. A raccoon took two-thirds of the remaining fries, leaving one-third. Let \( y \) be the remaining fries after the raccoon took its share. Then, \( y = \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) \).
8. After the raccoon, 5 fries were left, so \( y = 5 \).
9. Therefore, \( \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) = 5 \).
10. Solving for \( x \), we get \( x - 30 = 15 \) (multiplying both sides by 3).
11. Adding 30 to both sides, we get \( x = 45 \).

Each roll is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is 2 feet long. If Bill lines up everything he baked, how many feet will it be in total?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Convert the lengths of rolls and croissants from inches to feet.
   - Each roll is 4 inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so each roll is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet.
   - Each croissant is 6 inches. So each croissant is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet.

2. Calculate the total length of all rolls in feet.
   - 300 rolls, each \( \frac{1}{3} \) feet long: \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.

3. Calculate the total length of all croissants in feet.
   - 120 croissants, each \( \frac{1}{2} \) feet long: \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.

4. Calculate the total length of all baguettes in feet.
   - 60 baguettes, each 2 feet long: \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

5. Add up the total lengths.
   - Total length = 100 feet (rolls) + 60 feet (croissants) + 120 feet (baguettes) = 280 feet.

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the total distance Blake ran:
   - Each back and forth on a 100-yard field is 200 yards.
   - Blake runs back and forth 15 times.
   - Total distance Blake ran = 15 * 200 = 3000 yards.

   - Kelly runs back and forth once on the 100-yard field, which is 200 yards.
   - Then she runs to the 40-yard line and back, which is 80 yards each time.
   - She does this 34 times.
   - Total distance for the 34 runs to the 40-yard line and back = 34 * 80 = 2720 yards.
   - Adding the initial back and forth run: 2720 + 200 = 2920 yards.

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Let Brooke's current age be \( B \).
2. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is \( 2B \).
3. In two years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( 2B + 2 \).
4. The sum of their ages in two years is given as 28. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28
   \]
5. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28

   \[
   3B + 4 = 28

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Pancho walks 20 miles each day from Monday to Friday. There are 5 weekdays.
   So, the total miles walked on weekdays = 20 miles/day * 5 days = 100 miles.
2. On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), he walks 10 miles each day. There are 2 weekend days.
   So, the total miles walked on weekends = 10 miles/day * 2 days = 20 miles.

   Total miles in a week = 100 miles (weekdays) + 20 miles (weekends) = 120 miles.

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. First, calculate the time it takes to peel one potato: 1.5 minutes.

They spend $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar per gallon. They sell it for $0.50 per cup and can make 20 cups per gallon. If they made a profit of $25, how much did they spend on lemons?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the revenue from selling 1 gallon of lemonade:
   - 1 gallon makes 20 cups.
   - Each cup sells for $0.50.
   - Revenue per gallon = 20 cups * $0.50/cup = $10.

2. Calculate the cost to make 1 gallon of lemonade:
   - Cost of lemons per gallon = $3.
   - Cost of sugar per gallon = $2.
   - Total cost per gallon = $3 + $2 = $5.

3. Calculate the profit per gallon:
   - Profit per gallon = Revenue per gallon - Cost per gallon.
   - Profit per gallon = $10 - $5 = $5.

4. Determine how many gallons were sold to make a profit of $25:
   - Total profit = $25.
   - Profit per gallon = $5.
   - Number of gallons sold = $25 / $5 per gallon = 5 gallons.

5. Calculate the total amount spent on lemons for 5 gallons:
   - Cost of lemons per gallon = $3.
   - Total cost for 5 gallons = 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15.

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Let the number of white carnations be \( x \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which is five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, \( 5x = 200 \).
3. Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \). So, there are 40 white carnations.
4. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Therefore, the number of red roses is \( 4x \).

Each team has 4 members who each run 400 meters, or one standard track lap. One team has evenly matched abilities, with each member running 400 meters in exactly 55 seconds. The other team has some variation in abilities: the first runner completes 400 meters in 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner runs 3 seconds faster than the previous one. Based on this information, by how many seconds will the winning team win?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the total time for the first team:
   - Each of the 4 members runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
   - Total time for the first team = 4 * 55 = 220 seconds.

2. Calculate the total time for the second team:
   - The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds.
   - The second runner runs 400 meters in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
   - The third runner runs 400 meters in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
   - The fourth runner runs 400 meters in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
   - Total time for the second team = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

3. Determine the difference in time between the two teams:

",ジェリーは6面ダイスを振っている。彼が3よりも大きい数を出す確率は、偶数を2回連続で出す確率よりも（何%）高いか？,25,"Translation to English: Jerry is rolling a 6-sided die. By what percentage is the probability of him rolling a number greater than 3 higher than the probability of rolling an even number twice in a row?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a 6-sided die.
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a 6-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 such numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - Probability = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

2. Calculate the probability of rolling an even number on a 6-sided die.
   - The even numbers on a 6-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - There are 3 such numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - Probability of rolling an even number once = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

3. Calculate the probability of rolling an even number twice in a row.
   - Since each roll is independent, the probability of rolling an even number twice is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.

4. Determine the difference in probabilities.
   - Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 50%.
   - Probability of rolling an even number twice in a row = 25%.
   - Difference = 50% - 25% = 25%.

The answer is 25%.",True,257,256,True

There are 3 cages, each with the same number of mice, and each mouse is given 6 straws. Separately, there are 10 cages, each with one hamster, and each hamster is given 5 straws. Additionally, there is a rabbit hutch, and 20 straws are given to all the rabbits. Straw is not used for any other purpose in this pet shop. If a total of 160 straws are given to the rodents, how many mice are in one cage?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Let \( x \) be the number of mice in one cage.
2. There are 3 cages of mice, so the total number of mice is \( 3x \).
3. Each mouse gets 6 straws, so the total number of straws for the mice is \( 3x \times 6 = 18x \).
4. There are 10 cages with one hamster each, and each hamster gets 5 straws. So, the total number of straws for the hamsters is \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \).
5. The rabbit hutch gets 20 straws.
6. The total number of straws given to all the rodents is 160.

We can set up the equation:
\[ 18x + 50 + 20 = 160 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 18x + 70 = 160 \]

Subtract 70 from both sides:
\[ 18x = 90 \]

Divide both sides by 18:
\[ x = 5 \]

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Mandy owes $100 initially.
2. The interest rate is 2% per month.
3. To find the amount after 3 months, we use the formula for compound interest: \( A = P(1 + r)^n \), where \( P \) is the principal amount, \( r \) is the monthly interest rate, and \( n \) is the number of months.

Let's calculate it step by step:
- \( P = 100 \)
- \( r = 0.02 \)
- \( n = 3 \)

4. Plugging in the values:
\[ A = 100(1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100(1.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100 \times 1.061208 \]
\[ A = 106.12 \]

Translation to English: Question: Leah had 32 chocolates and her sister had 42. If they ate 35, how many pieces do they have left in total?.
Step-by-Step Answer: Leah had 32 chocolates and Leah’s sister had 42. That means there were originally 32 + 42 = 74 chocolates. 35 have been eaten. So in total they still have 74 - 35 = 39 chocolates. The answer is 39.
",トムは年に10本の木を植えます。毎年彼は、1年に2本の木を伐採します。彼は50本の木から始めます。10年後、30%の木は枯れます。彼には何本の木が残りますか？,91,"Translation to English: Tom plants 10 trees a year. Every year, he cuts down 2 trees. He starts with 50 trees. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. How many trees does he have left?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Tom starts with 50 trees.
2. Each year, he plants 10 trees and cuts down 2 trees. So, the net increase in trees each year is 10 - 2 = 8 trees.
3. Over 10 years, the total increase in trees is 10 years * 8 trees/year = 80 trees.
4. Adding this to the initial 50 trees, Tom has 50 + 80 = 130 trees after 10 years.
5. After 10 years, 30% of the trees die. So, the number of trees that die is 30% of 130 = 0.30 * 130 = 39 trees.
6. Subtracting the dead trees from the total, Tom has 130 - 39 = 91 trees left.

He edits the same number of sentences each week for two publishers, and each publisher pays a different amount per sentence. Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A. Mark edits a total of 1,000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. How many cents does Mark earn each week?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Let the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher be \( x \).
2. Since he edits the same number of sentences for both publishers, the total number of sentences edited each week is \( 2x \).
3. Given that Mark edits a total of 1,000 sentences each week, we have:
   \[
   2x = 1,000
   \]
4. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{1,000}{2} = 500
   \]
   So, Mark edits 500 sentences for each publisher.

5. Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher A each week is:
   \[
   500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2,500 \text{ cents}
   \]

6. Publisher B pays twice as much as Publisher A, which is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence}
   \]
   Therefore, the amount Mark earns from Publisher B each week is:
   \[
   500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5,000 \text{ cents}
   \]

7. The total amount Mark earns each week is the sum of what he earns from both publishers:
   \[
   2,500 \text{ cents} + 5,000 \text{ cents} = 7,500 \text{ cents}

If John earns $2,000 per week throughout the year and received this award on the first day of the year, how much did John receive that year?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate John's original annual salary:
   - John earns $2,000 per week.
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.

3. Calculate John's new annual salary after the increase:
   - New annual salary = $104,000 + $5,200 = $109,200.

4. Add the one-time award payment to the new annual salary:

He ate a sandwich every day for lunch this week, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. On three days of the week, he ate a cheese omelet for breakfast, using 1 more slice of cheese per omelet than in a sandwich. On some days of the week, he continued to eat macaroni and cheese from a large plate, which used 8 slices of cheese. How many slices of cheese did he use in total this week?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch, using 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. There are 7 days in a week, so:
   \( 7 \text{ days} \times 2 \text{ slices/day} = 14 \text{ slices} \)

2. On three days, he ate a cheese omelet for breakfast, using 1 more slice of cheese per omelet than in a sandwich. Since a sandwich uses 2 slices, an omelet uses:
   \( 2 \text{ slices} + 1 \text{ slice} = 3 \text{ slices} \)
   Therefore, for 3 days:
   \( 3 \text{ days} \times 3 \text{ slices/day} = 9 \text{ slices} \)

3. He ate macaroni and cheese on some days, using 8 slices of cheese in total. Since the problem does not specify the number of days, we assume it is a single instance:
   \( 8 \text{ slices} \)

Mr. Bart gives 6 tests each semester. He allows students to drop the lowest score from their average. If Brinley scored 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 on the first 5 tests, what score does she need on the 6th test to have an average of 93?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. To find the required score on the 6th test, we first need to determine the total score Brinley needs to achieve an average of 93 after dropping the lowest score.
2. Since the average is calculated after dropping the lowest score, we need to find the total score for the remaining 5 tests.
3. The formula for the average is: (Total Score) / (Number of Tests) = Average.
4. Rearranging the formula to find the total score: Total Score = Average * Number of Tests.
5. Brinley wants an average of 93 over 5 tests: Total Score = 93 * 5 = 465.
6. Next, we calculate the sum of Brinley's first 5 test scores: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438.
7. To find the score needed on the 6th test, we need to consider the lowest score (71) will be dropped.
8. The sum of the highest 4 scores from the first 5 tests is: 89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367.
9. To achieve a total of 465, the sum of the highest 4 scores plus the 6th test score must equal 465: 367 + 6th test score = 465.
10. Solving for the 6th test score: 6th test score = 465 - 367 = 98.

   - He rides 2 times a week, covering 60 kilometers each time.
   - Distance per week = 2 times * 60 kilometers = 120 kilometers.
   - For 3 weeks, the total distance = 3 weeks * 120 kilometers = 360 kilometers.

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. First, determine the total cost of half a dozen plates:
   - Half a dozen plates cost $6000.

2. Since 20 dozen cups are $1200 cheaper than the total cost of the plates, we need to find the total cost of the plates and then subtract $1200:
   - Total cost of the plates = $6000
   - Total cost of 20 dozen cups = $6000 - $1200 = $4800

3. Now, calculate the total number of cups in 20 dozen:
   - 1 dozen = 12 cups
   - 20 dozen = 20 * 12 = 240 cups

4. Finally, find the cost per cup by dividing the total cost of the cups by the number of cups:
   - Total cost of 240 cups = $4800
   - Cost per cup = $4800 / 240 = $20

Her parents give her $4 each time she mows the lawn. If Sarah already had $10 saved before she started babysitting, how many times does she need to mow the lawn to get the jacket and shoes?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes:
   - Jacket: $30
   - Shoes: 2 pairs at $20 each, so 2 * $20 = $40
   - Total cost: $30 + $40 = $70

2. Calculate the total amount Sarah has earned from babysitting:
   - She babysat 4 times and earned $5 each time, so 4 * $5 = $20

3. Calculate Sarah's total savings before mowing the lawn:
   - She already had $10 saved and earned $20 from babysitting, so $10 + $20 = $30

4. Determine how much more money Sarah needs to reach $70:
   - She needs $70 - $30 = $40 more

The red chickens lay 3 eggs a day, and the white chickens lay 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. If he owns 2 more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Let the number of red chickens be \( R \).
2. Since Jerry has 2 more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is \( R + 2 \).
3. Red chickens lay 3 eggs each per day, so the total number of eggs from red chickens is \( 3R \).
4. White chickens lay 5 eggs each per day, so the total number of eggs from white chickens is \( 5(R + 2) \).
5. The total number of eggs collected per day is 42, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   3R + 5(R + 2) = 42
   \]
6. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   3R + 5R + 10 = 42
   \]
   \[
   8R + 10 = 42
   \]
7. Subtract 10 from both sides:
   \[
   8R = 32

Four minutes ago, the larger pool had twice as much water as the smaller pool. Now, the larger pool has four times as much water as the smaller pool. How much water is in the smaller pool now?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Let \( S \) be the amount of water in the smaller pool 4 minutes ago.
2. Then, the larger pool had \( 2S \) gallons of water 4 minutes ago.
3. Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.
4. In 4 minutes, each pool would have lost \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons of water.
5. The amount of water in the smaller pool now is \( S - 16 \) gallons.
6. The amount of water in the larger pool now is \( 2S - 16 \) gallons.
7. According to the problem, the larger pool now has four times as much water as the smaller pool.
8. Therefore, \( 2S - 16 = 4(S - 16) \).
9. Simplify the equation: \( 2S - 16 = 4S - 64 \).
10. Rearrange the equation: \( 64 - 16 = 4S - 2S \).
11. Simplify further: \( 48 = 2S \).
12. Solve for \( S \): \( S = 24 \).

So, the amount of water in the smaller pool 4 minutes ago was 24 gallons. Now, the smaller pool has \( 24 - 16 = 8 \) gallons of water.

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Naomi scored 68 points.
2. Yuri scored 10 more points than half of Naomi's points. Half of Naomi's points is 68 / 2 = 34. Therefore, Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

4. The total points scored by all four students is 251 points. So, the points scored by Jojo can be calculated as follows:
   Total points = Points by Naomi + Points by Yuri + Points by Brianna + Points by Jojo
   251 = 68 + 44 + 85 + Points by Jojo

",ジェイムズはロバートより6つ多くキャンディをもっています。ジョンはロバートの2倍の数のキャンディをもっています。ジョンが54個のキャンディをもっている場合、ジョンはジェイムズに比べてキャンディを何個多くもっていますか？,21,"Translation to English: James has 6 more candies than Robert. John has twice as many candies as Robert. If John has 54 candies, how many more candies does John have compared to James?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).
2. According to the problem, John has twice as many candies as Robert. Therefore, \( 2R = 54 \).
3. Solving for \( R \), we get \( R = 54 / 2 = 27 \). So, Robert has 27 candies.
4. James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has \( 27 + 6 = 33 \) candies.
5. John has 54 candies.
6. To find out how many more candies John has compared to James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has: \( 54 - 33 = 21 \).

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Mike has 5 pen pals but stopped corresponding with 2, so he now has 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals.
2. Each pen pal sends 2 letters per week, and each letter consists of 5 pages. Therefore, each pen pal sends 2 * 5 = 10 pages per week.
3. Since Mike has 3 pen pals, the total number of pages he needs to write per week is 3 * 10 = 30 pages.
4. Mike can write one page in 6 minutes. Therefore, the total time he spends writing per week is 30 pages * 6 minutes per page = 180 minutes.

In another aquarium, there are 32 snails. The difference between them is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums.

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. First, calculate the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums:

If one cookie has 200 calories, how many more calories did Sue consume compared to her sister?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Determine the number of cookies Sue ate on Monday and Tuesday.
   - Monday: Sue ate the same number of cookies as her sister, which is 5 cookies.

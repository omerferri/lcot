Step-by-Step Answer: Wendi gives her chickens three meals a day. She has already given them 15 bowls in the morning and 25 bowls in the afternoon. 

First, we need to determine the total number of bowls given in the morning and afternoon:
15 (morning) + 25 (afternoon) = 40 bowls.

Since she feeds them three times a day, the total number of bowls needed for the entire day is:
3 meals/day * 20 chickens = 60 bowls.

To find out how many bowls are needed for the last meal, we subtract the bowls already given from the total daily requirement:
60 (total daily bowls) - 40 (bowls already given) = 20 bowls.

","Jean conduit pendant 3 heures à une vitesse de 60 mph, puis fait demi-tour après avoir constaté qu'il a oublié une chose très importante à la maison. Il essaie de rentrer en 4 heures, mais perd les 2 premières heures dans les embouteillages. Durant la demi-heure suivante, il conduit à 30 mph, avant de rouler à 80 mph pendant le temps restant sur les 4 heures. Quelle distance le sépare de son domicile à la fin des 4 heures ?",45,"Translation to English: Question: Jean drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, then turns back after realizing he forgot something very important at home. He tries to return in 4 hours but loses the first 2 hours in traffic. During the next half hour, he drives at 30 mph, before driving at 80 mph for the remaining time of the 4 hours. What distance is he from his home at the end of the 4 hours?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Jean drives for 3 hours at 60 mph. The distance he covers is:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. Jean tries to return home in 4 hours but loses the first 2 hours in traffic, so he doesn't cover any distance during these 2 hours.

3. During the next half hour (0.5 hours), he drives at 30 mph. The distance he covers is:
   \[
   0.5 \text{ hours} \times 30 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ miles}
   \]

4. For the remaining 1.5 hours (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours), he drives at 80 mph. The distance he covers is:
   \[
   1.5 \text{ hours} \times 80 \text{ mph} = 120 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. Adding the distances covered on the return trip:
   \[
   15 \text{ miles} + 120 \text{ miles} = 135 \text{ miles}
   \]

6. The total distance he initially drove away from home was 180 miles. The distance he managed to cover on his return trip is 135 miles. Therefore, the distance he is still away from home is:
   \[
   180 \text{ miles} - 135 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles}

Each year, the tree will produce 7 lemons which will be sold at $1.5 each. Watering and nutrition for the tree cost $3 per year. How many years will it take for Carlos to start making money with his lemon tree?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:
   - Each lemon is sold for $1.5.
   - The tree produces 7 lemons per year.
   - Annual revenue = 7 lemons * $1.5/lemon = $10.5.

2. Calculate the annual cost for watering and nutrition:
   - Annual cost = $3.

3. Calculate the net annual profit:
   - Net annual profit = Annual revenue - Annual cost.
   - Net annual profit = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

4. Determine the initial investment:
   - Initial investment = $90.

5. Calculate the number of years needed to recover the initial investment:
   - Number of years = Initial investment / Net annual profit.
   - Number of years = $90 / $7.5 = 12.

At the green house, she sold one-third of her vacuum cleaners, then 2 more at the red house, and finally half of what was left at the orange house. If Mélanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, how many vacuum cleaners did she have initially?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Let the initial number of vacuum cleaners be \( x \).
2. At the green house, she sold one-third of her vacuum cleaners, so she had \( \frac{2}{3}x \) left.
3. At the red house, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners, so she had \( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \) left.
4. At the orange house, she sold half of what was left, so she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \right) \) left.
5. We know that after all these sales, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{3}x - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
6. Solving the equation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}x - 2 = 10

","Un commerçant hésite entre 2 plans d'achat : des bijoux d'une valeur de 5 000 $ ou des gadgets électroniques d'une valeur de 8 000 $. Son conseiller financier spécule sur une hausse de 2,5 % du marché des bijoux et de 1,2 % de celui des gadgets électroniques au cours du même mois. Si le commerçant fait un choix qui lui permet de maximiser son profit à la fin du mois, quel serait le montant de ce profit ?",125,"Translation to English: Question: A merchant is hesitating between 2 purchase plans: jewelry worth $5,000 or electronic gadgets worth $8,000. His financial advisor speculates a 2.5% increase in the jewelry market and a 1.2% increase in the electronic gadgets market over the same month. If the merchant makes a choice that allows him to maximize his profit at the end of the month, what would be the amount of this profit?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the profit from the jewelry:
   - Initial value of jewelry: $5,000
   - Increase in value: 2.5%
   - Profit from jewelry = 5,000 * (2.5 / 100) = 5,000 * 0.025 = $125

2. Calculate the profit from the electronic gadgets:
   - Initial value of electronic gadgets: $8,000
   - Increase in value: 1.2%
   - Profit from electronic gadgets = 8,000 * (1.2 / 100) = 8,000 * 0.012 = $96

3. Compare the profits:
   - Profit from jewelry: $125
   - Profit from electronic gadgets: $96

Since $125 is greater than $96, the merchant should choose the jewelry to maximize his profit.

The answer is $125.",True,257,256,True

When mixing it with 15 liters of pineapple juice composed of three-quarters water, I spill one liter of orange juice. How much water is there in the remaining 24 liters?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange juice:
   - Two-thirds of 10 liters is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67\) liters of water.

2. Calculate the amount of water in the 15 liters of pineapple juice:
   - Three-quarters of 15 liters is \(\frac{3}{4} \times 15 = \frac{45}{4} = 11.25\) liters of water.

3. Determine the amount of water in the 1 liter of orange juice that was spilled:
   - Two-thirds of 1 liter is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 1 = \frac{2}{3} \approx 0.67\) liters of water.

4. Subtract the water lost from the spilled orange juice from the total water:
   - Total water from orange juice before spilling: 6.67 liters
   - Water lost from spilling: 0.67 liters
   - Remaining water from orange juice: 6.67 - 0.67 = 6.00 liters

5. Add the remaining water from the orange juice to the water from the pineapple juice:
   - Total water = 6.00 liters (orange juice) + 11.25 liters (pineapple juice) = 17.25 liters

2. The second friend estimates 20 more than half of the first estimate. Half of 80 is 40, and 20 more than 40 is 40 + 20 = 60.
3. The third friend estimates 25% more than the first estimate. 25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20, so 25% more than 80 is 80 + 20 = 100.

Now, we need to find the average of these three estimates:
- First estimate: 80
- Second estimate: 60
- Third estimate: 100

The sum of the estimates is 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

The average is the sum of the estimates divided by the number of estimates:
240 / 3 = 80.

The answer is 80.",True,252,251,False

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \). According to the problem, the number of gold coins is \( S + 30 \).

The total number of coins is given as 110. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

Simplifying the equation:
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 80 \]

Divide by 2:
\[ S = 40 \]

So, the number of silver coins is 40. The number of gold coins is:
\[ S + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70 \]

What is his running speed?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Jean runs a total of 60 miles each week.
2. He runs 3 days a week.
3. On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
4. On the other two days, he runs half as much as he does on the first day.

First, let's determine how many miles Jean runs on the first day:
- Let \( x \) be the number of miles he runs on the first day.
- On the other two days, he runs \( \frac{x}{2} \) miles each day.

The total distance he runs in a week is:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} = 60 \]

Combining the terms:
\[ x + \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} = x + x = 2x \]
\[ 2x = 60 \]
\[ x = 30 \]

So, Jean runs 30 miles on the first day. On the other two days, he runs:
\[ \frac{30}{2} = 15 \] miles each day.

Now, let's find his running speed:
- On the first day, he runs 30 miles in 3 hours.
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour} \]

If she jumps at a speed of 3 miles per hour, how many miles does she travel in six hours, knowing that she spends 1/3 of the time running and 2/3 of the time walking?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Dana jumps at a speed of 3 miles per hour.
2. Since she jumps twice as slow as she runs, her running speed is 3 miles per hour * 2 = 6 miles per hour.
3. Dana runs four times faster than she walks, so her walking speed is 6 miles per hour / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.
4. Dana spends 1/3 of the time running and 2/3 of the time walking.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many articles as she wrote on Tuesday. Calculate the total number of hours spent writing articles during these three days.

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles.
2. Each article takes 4 hours, so on Monday she spent 5 * 4 = 20 hours.

3. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday.
   - 2/5 of 5 articles is (2/5) * 5 = 2 articles.

If she had only 23 sticky notes left afterwards, how many sticky notes were in the pack she bought?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Candice initially had 80 sticky notes.
2. She bought an additional pack of sticky notes, which we need to determine the quantity of.
3. She used 220 sticky notes at work (one for each coffee cup).
4. After using the sticky notes, she had 23 left.

Let's denote the number of sticky notes in the pack she bought as \( x \).

The total number of sticky notes she had after buying the pack is:
\[ 80 + x \]

She used 220 sticky notes, so the remaining sticky notes are:
\[ (80 + x) - 220 \]

We know she had 23 sticky notes left, so:
\[ (80 + x) - 220 = 23 \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ 80 + x - 220 = 23 \]

",Jean achète deux fois plus de cravates rouges que de cravates bleues. Les cravates rouges coûtent 50 % de plus. Il a dépensé 200 $ pour les cravates bleues qui coûtent 40 $ chacune. Combien a-t-il dépensé en cravates ?,800,"Translation to English: Jean buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. The red ties cost 50% more. He spent $200 on blue ties that cost $40 each. How much did he spend on ties in total?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. First, determine the number of blue ties Jean bought. He spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40.
   \[
   \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
   \]

2. Since Jean buys twice as many red ties as blue ties:
   \[
   \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

3. The cost of each red tie is 50% more than the cost of each blue tie. The cost of each blue tie is $40, so:
   \[
   \text{Cost of each red tie} = 40 + (0.5 \times 40) = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]

4. Calculate the total amount spent on red ties:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of red ties} = 10 \times 60 = 600
   \]

5. Jean spent $200 on blue ties. Adding the amount spent on red ties:
   \[
   \text{Total amount spent on ties} = 200 + 600 = 800

If the streaming company charged this amount for the first half of the year, then 10% less during the other half of the year, calculate the total amount she paid for the streaming service at the end of the year.

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Aleena pays $140 per month for the first half of the year (6 months).
   - Total for the first half of the year: 6 months * $140/month = $840.

2. For the second half of the year, she is charged 10% less than $140 per month.

He notices that each floor of a sandcastle has half the area of the floor below it. What is the average area of a floor, knowing that the sandcastle has 4 floors and the top floor has an area of 16 square feet?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. The top floor (4th floor) has an area of 16 square feet.
2. The 3rd floor has twice the area of the 4th floor: 16 * 2 = 32 square feet.
3. The 2nd floor has twice the area of the 3rd floor: 32 * 2 = 64 square feet.
4. The 1st floor has twice the area of the 2nd floor: 64 * 2 = 128 square feet.

Now, we sum the areas of all four floors:
128 (1st floor) + 64 (2nd floor) + 32 (3rd floor) + 16 (4th floor) = 240 square feet.

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Cecilia needs to give 1 bowl of food every day for the first 180 days.

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. First, calculate how much water each girl received. Each girl received 1/6 of 24 liters.
   \[
   \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \text{ liters}
   \]
2. Since there are two girls, the total amount of water received by the girls is:
   \[
   2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ liters}

3. Next, the boy received 6 liters of water.
4. The total amount of water given to the girls and the boy is:
   \[
   8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters}
   \]
5. The initial amount of water was 24 liters. Subtract the total amount given away to find the remaining water:

Step-by-Step Answer: Let's denote the number of matches the team lost as \( L \). According to the problem, the team won \( _ \times L \) matches. The total number of matches played is the sum of matches won and lost, which is given as 22.

So, we have the equation:
\[ L + _ \times L = 22 \]

This can be simplified to:
\[ L (1 + _) = 22 \]

To find the number of matches won, we need to solve for \( L \) and then multiply by \( _ \).

It has a policy of adding 10% to the initial salary of each of its employees who have five years of seniority. If Sylvie just completed 5 years in the company last December, what will her annual salary be after three more years of service?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Sylvie's initial monthly salary is $600.
2. After completing 5 years, she gets a 10% increase on her initial salary.
3. 10% of $600 is $600 * 0.10 = $60.
4. Therefore, her new monthly salary after the increase is $600 + $60 = $660.
5. To find her annual salary, we multiply her new monthly salary by 12.
6. $660 * 12 = $7,920.

If they sold 88,000 copies together, how many copies did Harald sell?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
Let the number of copies Harald sold be \( x \). 
Then, the number of copies Marilyn sold is \( 10x \).

Together, they sold \( x + 10x = 11x \) copies.

We know that \( 11x = 88,000 \).

He knows that it will take 10 pounds for an adult dinosaur and half that amount for a child. If 20 adults and 5 children are present at the picnic, how many kilograms of potato salad will Ted need to bring to hope to feed everyone?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the adults:
   - Each adult needs 10 pounds.
   - There are 20 adults.
   - Total for adults: 20 adults * 10 pounds/adult = 200 pounds.

   - Each child needs half of 10 pounds, which is 5 pounds.
   - There are 5 children.
   - Total for children: 5 children * 5 pounds/child = 25 pounds.

3. Add the amounts needed for adults and children:
   - Total potato salad needed: 200 pounds (adults) + 25 pounds (children) = 225 pounds.

4. Convert pounds to kilograms (1 pound ≈ 0.453592 kilograms):

How many girls are not part of the scouts?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. First, determine the number of boys:
   - 2/5 of 200 students are boys.
   - Number of boys = (2/5) * 200 = 80 boys.

3. Determine the number of girls who are members of the scouts:
   - 2/3 of the girls are members of the scouts.
   - Number of girls in scouts = (2/3) * 120 = 80 girls.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. The final volume of the sauce is 32 ounces.
2. Since the tomatoes lose half of their volume when cooked, the original volume of the tomatoes must have been twice the final volume of the sauce. Therefore, the original volume is 32 ounces * 2 = 64 ounces.
3. Each can is 16 ounces, so the number of cans used is 64 ounces / 16 ounces per can = 4 cans.

","Un banc de brouillard arrive de l'océan et recouvre progressivement une ville. Il met 10 minutes pour couvrir 3 miles de la ville. Si la ville s'étend sur 42 miles depuis le bord de l'océan jusqu'au bord opposé à l'intérieur des terres, combien de minutes faudra-t-il au banc de brouillard pour couvrir toute la ville ?",140,"Translation to English: A fog bank arrives from the ocean and gradually covers a city. It takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles of the city. If the city extends 42 miles from the ocean's edge to the opposite inland edge, how many minutes will it take for the fog bank to cover the entire city?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. The fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes.
2. To find out how many 3-mile segments are in 42 miles, we divide 42 by 3: 
   \( 42 \div 3 = 14 \).
3. Each 3-mile segment takes 10 minutes to cover.
4. Therefore, to cover 14 segments, it will take \( 14 \times 10 = 140 \) minutes.

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. First, calculate the interior dimensions of one box by subtracting the wall thickness from each dimension.
   - Length: 5 inches - 2 inches (1 inch on each side) = 3 inches
   - Width: 6 inches - 2 inches (1 inch on each side) = 4 inches
   - Height: 4 inches - 2 inches (1 inch on each side) = 2 inches

2. Calculate the interior volume of one box using the interior dimensions.
   - Volume of one box = Length × Width × Height = 3 inches × 4 inches × 2 inches = 24 cubic inches

3. Since there are 3 boxes, multiply the volume of one box by 3 to get the total interior volume.

Last Monday and Tuesday, he watched one episode of his favorite show for 1 hour each evening. On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show.

If he watched a total of 7 hours of television, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the total time spent watching TV on Monday and Tuesday:
   - Monday: 1 hour
   - Tuesday: 1 hour
   Total for Monday and Tuesday = 1 + 1 = 2 hours

2. Calculate the total time spent watching TV on Thursday:

   - Two 1-hour episodes = 2 hours

4. Add the time spent on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:
   - 2 hours (Monday and Tuesday) + 1.5 hours (Thursday) + 2 hours (Friday) = 5.5 hours

5. Subtract the total time spent on these days from the total 7 hours to find the time spent on Wednesday:

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henri made last year.
2. This year, he plans to make \( 2x \) cookies (twice as many as last year).
3. He ends up making 15 more than planned, so he actually makes \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. He drops 5 cookies, so the number of cookies left is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \).
5. We know he ends up with 110 cookies, so we set up the equation:

The boat started taking in two liters of water every ten feet rowed towards the shore. It took her sixteen seconds to cover twenty feet. The shore was 64 seconds away. How much water had the boat taken in when Julia reached the shore?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Julia took 16 seconds to cover 20 feet.
2. The shore is 64 seconds away.
3. To find out how many feet Julia rowed in 64 seconds, we use the ratio:
   \[
   \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{16 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{x \text{ feet}}{64 \text{ seconds}}
   \]
   Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{20 \times 64}{16} = 80 \text{ feet}
   \]

4. The boat takes in 2 liters of water every 10 feet.
5. To find out how many 10-foot segments are in 80 feet:
   \[
   \frac{80 \text{ feet}}{10 \text{ feet/segment}} = 8 \text{ segments}
   \]

6. Each segment results in 2 liters of water taken in:
   \[
   8 \text{ segments} \times 2 \text{ liters/segment} = 16 \text{ liters}

She decides to sell the wood she has left. She has ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards left, which cost her $10 each. She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards that she bought for $16 each. If she manages to sell them all, what will her profit be?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the original cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 boards:
   - Sasha has 10 boards, each costing $10.
   - Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $10/board = $100.

2. Calculate the original cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 boards:
   - Sasha has 5 boards, each costing $16.
   - Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $16/board = $80.

3. Calculate the total original cost of all the boards:
   - Total original cost = $100 (for 2 x 4 x 10 boards) + $80 (for 4 x 4 x 10 boards) = $180.

4. Calculate the selling price after a 50% increase:
   - For the 2 x 4 x 10 boards: Original price = $10, increased by 50% = $10 * 1.5 = $15 per board.
   - For the 4 x 4 x 10 boards: Original price = $16, increased by 50% = $16 * 1.5 = $24 per board.

5. Calculate the total selling price:
   - Selling price for 2 x 4 x 10 boards = 10 boards * $15/board = $150.
   - Selling price for 4 x 4 x 10 boards = 5 boards * $24/board = $120.
   - Total selling price = $150 + $120 = $270.

   - Profit = Total selling price - Total original cost = $270 - $180 = $90.

The next day, new containers arrived and brought the total number of vehicles in the port to 30. Calculate the number of containers imported on the second day, assuming all containers contain 5 vehicles.

Step-by-Step Answer: Initially, there were 2 containers with 5 vehicles each. So, the initial number of vehicles is 2 * 5 = 10 vehicles. The total number of vehicles after the new containers arrived is 30. Therefore, the number of vehicles that arrived on the second day is 30 - 10 = 20 vehicles. Since each container contains 5 vehicles, the number of containers imported on the second day is 20 / 5 = 4 containers. The answer is 4.",True,179,178,False

Four years later, this salary had increased and was 40% higher than what he was earning initially. If Adrien and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously, and Adrien was earning $40,000 four years ago, calculate the total amount of their two salaries four years later.

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Adrien's salary four years ago was $40,000.
2. Four years later, Adrien's salary increased by 40%. So, his new salary is:
   \[
   40,000 + (40,000 \times 0.40) = 40,000 + 16,000 = 56,000
   \]

3. Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's salary four years ago. Let Lylah's salary four years ago be \( L \).
   \[
   40,000 = L + (L \times 0.30) = L \times 1.30
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \approx 30,769.23
   \]

4. Assuming Lylah's salary also increased by the same percentage (40%) over the four years, her new salary is:
   \[
   30,769.23 + (30,769.23 \times 0.40) = 30,769.23 + 12,307.69 \approx 43,076.92
   \]

5. The total amount of their two salaries four years later is:
   \[
   56,000 + 43,076.92 \approx 99,076.92

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Each patient is examined for 24 minutes. To convert this to hours: 24 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 0.4 hours per patient.

Knowing that a 10% tax applies to all non-food items, how much did it all cost?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Identify the food items and their costs:
   - Milk: $2

Si Tim se déplace en skateboard à une vitesse de 264 pieds par minute, combien de temps le gagnant attendra-t-il chez lui avant que le perdant ne termine la course ?",4,"Translation to English: Question: Steve and Tim decide to see who will get home from school the fastest. Steve lives farther away than Tim and is therefore allowed to use his bike. Steve lives 3 miles from school and pedals at 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles from school. If Tim travels by skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner wait at home before the loser finishes the race?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Convert the distances from miles to feet:
   - 1 mile = 5280 feet
   - Steve's distance: 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet
   - Tim's distance: 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet

2. Calculate the time it takes for each to get home:
   - Steve's time: 15840 feet / 440 feet per minute = 36 minutes
   - Tim's time: 10560 feet / 264 feet per minute = 40 minutes

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Each bike has 2 tires. 5 people came with bikes, so the total number of bike tires is 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
2. Each tricycle has 3 tires. 3 people came with tricycles, so the total number of tricycle tires is 3 * 3 = 9 tires.

Later, a raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. The ants took away one last fry, leaving five fries. How many fries were in the packet when Dave bought it?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate: \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. Three pigeons ate 3 fries each: \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.

8. The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, leaving one-third: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of \( x - 30 \).
9. After the raccoon, the remaining fries were \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) \).
10. The ants took away one fry, leaving five fries: \( \frac{1}{3} (x - 30) - 1 = 5 \).

","Blake et Kelly s'affrontent pour savoir qui peut courir le plus en 15 minutes. Ils décident de le faire sur un terrain de football de 100 yards de long. Blake fait 15 allers-retours. Kelly fait un aller-retour, puis décide qu'elle ne veut pas courir aux côtés de Blake. Elle commence donc à faire l'aller-retour en se limitant à la ligne des 40 yards. Elle le fait 34 fois. Combien de yards le gagnant a-t-il couru de plus que le perdant ?",80,"Translation to English: Question: Blake and Kelly compete to see who can run the most in 15 minutes. They decide to do it on a football field that is 100 yards long. Blake does 15 round trips. Kelly does one round trip, then decides she doesn't want to run alongside Blake. So she starts doing round trips limited to the 40-yard line. She does it 34 times. How many yards did the winner run more than the loser?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the total distance Blake ran:
   - Each round trip on a 100-yard field is 200 yards.
   - Blake did 15 round trips.
   - Total distance Blake ran = 15 * 200 = 3000 yards.

2. Calculate the total distance Kelly ran:
   - Kelly did 1 round trip on the 100-yard field, which is 200 yards.
   - Then she did 34 round trips on the 40-yard line.
   - Each round trip on the 40-yard line is 80 yards (40 yards each way).
   - Total distance for 34 round trips = 34 * 80 = 2720 yards.
   - Total distance Kelly ran = 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

3. Determine the difference in distance:
   - Blake ran 3000 yards.
   - Kelly ran 2920 yards.
   - Difference = 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

She has a budget of 1,500 € given by her whole family and thinks she can save some to buy a piece of clothing. She goes to a computer store and chooses a device that costs 1,090 € with a screen, a keyboard, and a mouse. She also gets a scanner for 157 €, a CD burner for 74 €, and a printer for 102 €. How much money will she have left for her clothes?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Elvira's total budget is 1,500 €.
2. The cost of the computer with accessories (screen, keyboard, and mouse) is 1,090 €.
3. The cost of the scanner is 157 €.
4. The cost of the CD burner is 74 €.
5. The cost of the printer is 102 €.

First, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items she bought:
1,090 € (computer) + 157 € (scanner) + 74 € (CD burner) + 102 € (printer) = 1,423 €.

Next, we subtract the total cost from her budget to find out how much money she has left:
1,500 € (budget) - 1,423 € (total cost) = 77 €.

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Let Brooke's current age be \( B \).
2. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is \( 2B \).
3. In two years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( 2B + 2 \).
4. The sum of their ages in two years will be \( (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \).
5. Simplify the equation: \( B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28 \).
6. Combine like terms: \( 3B + 4 = 28 \).
7. Subtract 4 from both sides: \( 3B = 24 \).

","Jessica se demande combien d'argent elle doit payer chaque mois pour couvrir toutes ses dettes. Le paiement minimum de son prêt étudiant est de 300 $ par mois, celui de sa carte de crédit est de 200 $ par mois et celui de son prêt hypothécaire est de 500 $ par mois. Si Jessica veut payer 50 % de plus que le minimum, combien doit-elle payer en un an ?",18000,"Translation to English: Jessica wonders how much money she has to pay each month to cover all her debts. The minimum payment for her student loan is $300 per month, the minimum payment for her credit card is $200 per month, and the minimum payment for her mortgage is $500 per month. If Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum, how much does she have to pay in a year?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the total minimum monthly payment:
   - Student loan: $300
   - Credit card: $200
   - Mortgage: $500
   Total minimum monthly payment = $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000

2. Calculate 50% more than the minimum monthly payment:
   - 50% of $1000 = 0.5 * $1000 = $500
   - Total monthly payment with 50% more = $1000 + $500 = $1500

3. Calculate the total payment for one year:
   - Total monthly payment = $1500
   - Number of months in a year = 12
   Total yearly payment = $1500 * 12 = $18000

For each gallon, they spend $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar. They get 20 glasses of lemonade and sell them for $0.50 per glass. If they made a profit of $25, how much did they spend on lemons?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the total revenue from selling the lemonade:
   - They sell 20 glasses at $0.50 per glass.
   - Total revenue = 20 * $0.50 = $10 per gallon.

2. Calculate the total cost per gallon:
   - Cost of lemons per gallon = $3.
   - Cost of sugar per gallon = $2.
   - Total cost per gallon = $3 + $2 = $5.

3. Calculate the profit per gallon:
   - Profit per gallon = Total revenue per gallon - Total cost per gallon.
   - Profit per gallon = $10 - $5 = $5.

4. Determine the number of gallons sold to achieve a profit of $25:
   - Profit per gallon is $5.
   - Total profit is $25.
   - Number of gallons sold = $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

If Zaid earns $6,000 per month, how much money will he have left after all these expenses and donations?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the amount Zaid spends on rent:
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}

Sandra has threatened to change suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 PM. To keep Sandra as a customer, how many red roses does Fred need to deliver by 5 PM?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Let the number of white carnations be \( x \).
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which is five times the quantity of white carnations. Therefore, \( 5x = 200 \).
3. Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \). So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.

Its first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. Based on this information, by how many seconds will the fastest team win?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the total time for the well-trained team:
   - Each member runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
   - There are 4 members.
   - Total time = 4 * 55 = 220 seconds.

2. Calculate the total time for the less well-trained team:
   - The first runner runs 400 meters in 60 seconds.
   - The second runner is 3 seconds faster: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
   - The third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
   - The fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

",Jerry lance un dé à six faces.

What is the probability (in percentage) that he gets a number greater than 3 rather than an even number twice in a row?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. **Probability of getting a number greater than 3:**
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes (4, 5, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - Probability = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of outcomes = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5.
   - In percentage, this is 0.5 * 100 = 50%.

2. **Probability of getting an even number twice in a row:**
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes (2, 4, 6) out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - Probability of getting an even number in one roll = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5.
   - Probability of getting an even number twice in a row = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.
   - In percentage, this is 0.25 * 100 = 25%.

3. **Comparing the probabilities:**
   - Probability of getting a number greater than 3 = 50%.
   - Probability of getting an even number twice in a row = 25%.

Since the question asks for the probability that he gets a number greater than 3 rather than an even number twice in a row, we focus on the probability of getting a number greater than 3.

The rats are divided into 3 cages in equal groups and each rat receives 6 pieces of straw. There are 10 hamster cages. Each hamster is alone in its cage and receives 5 pieces of straw. There is also a rabbit pen where 20 pieces of straw are distributed. No straw is used elsewhere in the store. If 160 pieces of straw have been distributed to the small rodents, how many rats are there in each cage?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the total amount of straw given to the hamsters:
   - There are 10 hamster cages, and each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for hamsters = 10 * 5 = 50 pieces of straw.

2. Calculate the amount of straw given to the rabbits:
   - The rabbit pen receives 20 pieces of straw.

3. Calculate the total amount of straw given to the rats:
   - Total straw distributed = 160 pieces.
   - Straw for rats = Total straw distributed - Straw for hamsters - Straw for rabbits.
   - Straw for rats = 160 - 50 - 20 = 90 pieces of straw.

4. Determine the number of rats in each cage:
   - Let \( r \) be the number of rats in each cage.
   - There are 3 cages, and each rat receives 6 pieces of straw.
   - Total straw for rats = 3 * r * 6.
   - 3 * r * 6 = 90.

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. On Friday morning, there were 18 plastic flamingos in Sue's yard.

Step-by-Step Answer: Leah had 32 chocolates and Leah’s sister had 42. That means there were originally 32 + 42 = 74 chocolates. 35 have been eaten. So in total they still have 74 - 35 = 39 chocolates. The answer is 39.
","Jerry a un élevage de poulets. Les poules rouges produisent 3 œufs par jour, et les blanches 5 œufs par jour. Jerry ramasse chaque jour 42 œufs. S'il a deux poulets blancs de plus qu'il y en a de rouges, combien de poulets rouges a-t-il ?",4,"Translation to English: Question: Jerry has a chicken farm. The red hens produce 3 eggs per day, and the white hens produce 5 eggs per day. Jerry collects 42 eggs each day. If he has two more white hens than red hens, how many red hens does he have?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Let the number of red hens be \( R \).
2. Since Jerry has two more white hens than red hens, the number of white hens is \( R + 2 \).
3. Each red hen produces 3 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs from red hens is \( 3R \).
4. Each white hen produces 5 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs from white hens is \( 5(R + 2) \).
5. The total number of eggs collected each day is 42, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   3R + 5(R + 2) = 42
   \]
6. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   3R + 5R + 10 = 42
   \]
   \[
   8R + 10 = 42
   \]
7. Subtract 10 from both sides:
   \[
   8R = 32
   \]
8. Divide both sides by 8:
   \[
   R = 4

If he walks at 3 miles per hour, how many hours of walking does he do?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. First, we need to find the perimeter of the rectangular park. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is \( P = 2 \times (length + width) \).
2. Here, the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles. So, the perimeter \( P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \) miles.
3. Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour.
4. To find out how many hours he walks, we divide the total distance by his walking speed: \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \).

Four minutes ago, the large pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Now, it has four times as much. What is the amount of water in the small pool now?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Let \( S \) be the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago.
2. Then, the large pool had \( 2S \) gallons of water 4 minutes ago.
3. Both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute.
4. In 4 minutes, each pool would have lost \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons of water.
5. The current amount of water in the small pool is \( S - 16 \) gallons.
6. The current amount of water in the large pool is \( 2S - 16 \) gallons.
7. According to the problem, the large pool now has four times the amount of water as the small pool.
8. Therefore, \( 2S - 16 = 4(S - 16) \).

Solving the equation:
\[ 2S - 16 = 4(S - 16) \]
\[ 2S - 16 = 4S - 64 \]
\[ 2S - 4S = -64 + 16 \]
\[ -2S = -48 \]
\[ S = 24 \]

If she has to pay $165 per month for 12 months, how much money will Janeth have left by then?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the total amount Janeth needs to repay, including the 10% interest.
   - 10% of $2,000 is $2,000 * 0.10 = $200.
   - Total amount to repay = $2,000 + $200 = $2,200.

2. Calculate the total amount Janeth will pay over 12 months.
   - Monthly payment = $165.
   - Total payment over 12 months = $165 * 12 = $1,980.

3. Compare the total amount to be repaid with the total amount paid.
   - Total amount to be repaid = $2,200.
   - Total amount paid = $1,980.

4. Determine if there is any remaining balance or overpayment.
   - Since $1,980 is less than $2,200, Janeth will still owe money.
   - Remaining balance = $2,200 - $1,980 = $220.

Her mother places half as many pieces per minute. How many hours will it take them to complete the puzzle?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Determine the number of pieces Kalinda's mother can place per minute. Since she places half as many pieces as Kalinda, she places 4 / 2 = 2 pieces per minute.
2. Calculate the total number of pieces they can place together per minute. Kalinda places 4 pieces per minute and her mother places 2 pieces per minute, so together they place 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.
3. Calculate the total time in minutes required to complete the 360-piece puzzle. Since they place 6 pieces per minute, it will take 360 / 6 = 60 minutes to complete the puzzle.
4. Convert the total time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 60 minutes is equal to 60 / 60 = 1 hour.

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. The farm produced 120 baby watermelons.
2. After two months, 30% of the watermelons were ready to be harvested.

The others each send 2 letters of 5 pages every week. He responds to them in the same way. If he can write one page every 6 minutes, how many hours does he spend writing per week?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Mike was originally corresponding with 5 people but stopped corresponding with 2 of them. So, he is now corresponding with 5 - 2 = 3 people.
2. Each of these 3 people sends 2 letters of 5 pages every week. Therefore, each person sends 2 * 5 = 10 pages per week.
3. Since there are 3 people, the total number of pages Mike receives per week is 3 * 10 = 30 pages.
4. Mike responds to each letter in the same way, so he also writes 30 pages per week.
5. Mike can write one page every 6 minutes. Therefore, to write 30 pages, he needs 30 * 6 = 180 minutes.

Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, then Colby took 3 fewer fries from Griffin than the number of fries Kyle took. If, in the end, Griffin had 27 fries, how many fries did Ginger give to Griffin?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Griffin started with 24 fries.
2. Kyle took 5 fries from Griffin. So, Griffin had 24 - 5 = 19 fries left.
3. Billy took twice as many fries as Kyle. Since Kyle took 5 fries, Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries. So, Griffin had 19 - 10 = 9 fries left.
4. Colby took 3 fewer fries than Kyle. Since Kyle took 5 fries, Colby took 5 - 3 = 2 fries. So, Griffin had 9 - 2 = 7 fries left.
5. Let \( x \) be the number of fries Ginger gave to Griffin. After receiving \( x \) fries from Ginger, Griffin had 7 + \( x \) fries.
6. According to the problem, Griffin ended up with 27 fries. Therefore, we have the equation: 7 + \( x \) = 27.

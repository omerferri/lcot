Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Josh's total investment in the house is the sum of the purchase price and the repair costs: $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.
2. The value of the house increased by 150%. To find the new value, we calculate 150% of the total investment and add it to the original investment:

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the amount of the file downloaded before the restart:
   40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 = 80 GB.

2. Calculate the time taken to download 80 GB:

Step-by-Step Answer: Leah had 32 chocolates and Leah’s sister had 42. That means there were originally 32 + 42 = 74 chocolates. 35 have been eaten. So in total they still have 74 - 35 = 39 chocolates. The answer is 39.
",约翰以每小时 60 英里的速度开了 3 小时，然后掉头，因为他意识到自己把非常重要的东西忘在家里了。他尽量在 4 小时后赶到家，但前 2 个小时都消耗在堵塞的交通中了。在接下来的半个小时，他以每小时 30 英里的速度驾驶，然后在 4 小时剩下的时间里，才能以每小时 80 英里的速度行驶。4 个小时结束后，他距离家还有多远？,45,"Translation to English: Question: John drove for 3 hours at a speed of 60 miles per hour, then turned around because he realized he had forgotten something very important at home. He tried to get home in 4 hours, but the first 2 hours were spent in heavy traffic. In the next half hour, he drove at a speed of 30 miles per hour, and then for the remaining time of the 4 hours, he drove at a speed of 80 miles per hour. How far is he from home after the 4 hours?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the distance John drove in the first 3 hours:
   \[
   60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. John turns around and tries to get home in 4 hours. The first 2 hours are spent in heavy traffic, so he covers no distance in those 2 hours.

3. In the next half hour, he drives at 30 miles per hour:
   \[
   30 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ miles}
   \]

4. For the remaining 1.5 hours (4 hours - 2.5 hours), he drives at 80 miles per hour:
   \[
   80 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. Total distance covered on the return trip:
   \[
   15 \text{ miles} + 120 \text{ miles} = 135 \text{ miles}
   \]

6. Distance from home after 4 hours:
   \[
   180 \text{ miles} - 135 \text{ miles} = 45 \text{ miles}

She sold one-third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more at the red house, and half of the remaining vacuum cleaners at the orange house. If Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left, how many vacuum cleaners did she have initially?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Let the initial number of vacuum cleaners be \( x \).
2. Melanie sold one-third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she sold \( \frac{x}{3} \) there.
3. After selling at the green house, she had \( x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3} \) vacuum cleaners left.
4. She then sold 2 more at the red house, so she had \( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \) vacuum cleaners left.
5. At the orange house, she sold half of the remaining vacuum cleaners, so she sold \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \).
6. After selling at the orange house, she had \( \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) \) vacuum cleaners left.
7. According to the problem, she has 5 vacuum cleaners left, so:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2x}{3} - 2 \right) = 5
   \]
8. Solving for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} - 2 = 10
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 12

If the businessman expects to make the choice that will yield the highest profit by the end of the month, what will the profit be?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the profit from the jewelry:
   - Jewelry value: $5,000
   - Predicted increase: 2.5%
   - Profit from jewelry = $5,000 * 2.5% = $5,000 * 0.025 = $125

How much water is in the remaining 24 liters of drink?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the amount of water in the original 10 liters of orange juice drink:
   - Two-thirds of 10 liters is \(\frac{2}{3} \times 10 = 6.67\) liters of water.

2. Calculate the amount of water in the original 15 liters of pineapple juice drink:
   - Three-fifths of 15 liters is \(\frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9\) liters of water.

3. Determine the amount of orange juice drink left after spilling 1 liter:
   - 10 liters - 1 liter = 9 liters of orange juice drink left.

4. Calculate the amount of water in the remaining 9 liters of orange juice drink:
   - Since two-thirds of the original 10 liters was water, the same ratio applies to the remaining 9 liters.
   - \(\frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6\) liters of water in the remaining orange juice drink.

5. Add the remaining orange juice drink to the pineapple juice drink:
   - Total volume of the drink after mixing: 9 liters (orange juice) + 15 liters (pineapple juice) = 24 liters.

6. Calculate the total amount of water in the 24 liters of mixed drink:
   - Water from orange juice drink: 6 liters.
   - Water from pineapple juice drink: 9 liters.
   - Total water: 6 liters + 9 liters = 15 liters.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Let the number of silver coins be \( S \).
2. The number of gold coins is \( S + 30 \).
3. The total number of coins is given as 110.

So, we can set up the equation:
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]

4. Simplify the equation:
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]

5. Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 80 \]

6. Divide by 2:
\[ S = 40 \]

7. The number of gold coins is \( S + 30 \):
\[ 40 + 30 = 70 \]

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Dana's jumping speed is 3 miles per hour.
2. Her running speed is twice her jumping speed, so her running speed is 3 * 2 = 6 miles per hour.
3. Her running speed is four times her walking speed, so her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.
4. Dana spends one-third of the 6 hours running and two-thirds walking.
5. One-third of 6 hours is 6 / 3 = 2 hours.

If Polly holds the sapphire, how far outside the dragon's fire-breathing range can she stand to hit the dragon with the golden spear?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Without the sapphire, Polly can throw the golden spear 400 feet.
2. When Polly holds the sapphire, she can throw the golden spear three times as far. Therefore, the distance she can throw with the sapphire is 3 * 400 = 1200 feet.
3. The dragon's fire-breathing range is 1,000 feet.
4. To find out how far outside the dragon's fire-breathing range Polly can stand, we subtract the fire-breathing range from the distance Polly can throw with the sapphire: 1200 - 1000 = 200 feet.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Grandma Jones baked 5 pies, and each pie was cut into 8 slices. 
2. The total number of slices is 5 pies * 8 slices/pie = 40 slices.
3. By the end of lunch, 14 slices were left.
4. Therefore, the number of slices taken by the guests is 40 slices - 14 slices = 26 slices.

On average, it takes 4 hours to research and write a blog post. Last week, she wrote 5 blog posts on Monday. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more blog posts than on Monday. On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many blog posts as on Tuesday. Calculate the total time she spent writing blog posts over these three days.

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 blog posts.
2. On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more blog posts than on Monday. This means she wrote \( 5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7 \) blog posts.
3. On Wednesday, she wrote twice as many blog posts as on Tuesday. This means she wrote \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) blog posts.

Now, we calculate the total number of blog posts written over the three days:
- Monday: 5 blog posts
- Tuesday: 7 blog posts
- Wednesday: 14 blog posts

Total blog posts = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 blog posts.

The price of a red tie is 50% higher than the price of a blue tie. He spent $200 on blue ties, each costing $40. How much did he spend on ties in total?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Determine the number of blue ties John bought:
   - Each blue tie costs $40.
   - He spent $200 on blue ties.
   - Number of blue ties = $200 / $40 per tie = 5 blue ties.

2. Determine the number of red ties John bought:
   - He bought twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   - Number of red ties = 2 * 5 = 10 red ties.

3. Determine the price of each red tie:
   - The price of a red tie is 50% higher than the price of a blue tie.
   - Price of a red tie = $40 + 0.5 * $40 = $40 + $20 = $60.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. First, calculate the total number of units in the building. There are 15 floors and each floor has 8 units.
   Total units = 15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units.

2. Next, determine the number of occupied units. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied:
   Occupied units = 3/4 * 120 units = 90 units.

3. Finally, calculate the number of unoccupied units by subtracting the number of occupied units from the total number of units.
   Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units = 120 units - 90 units = 30 units.

3. Number of unripe oranges = 20% of 25 = 0.20 * 25 = 5.
4. Number of sour oranges = 2.

To find the number of good oranges, we subtract the bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges:

He noticed that each layer of the sandcastle has half the area of the layer below it. If he built a 4-layer sandcastle and the top layer has an area of 16, what is the average area of one layer?

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Let \( W \) be the number of matches they won.
2. Let \( L \) be the number of matches they lost.
3. According to the problem, \( W + L = 22 \) (total matches played).
4. Also, \( W = L + 8 \) (they won 8 more matches than they lost).

Substitute \( W = L + 8 \) into the first equation:
\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]
\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]
Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 2L = 14 \]
Divide by 2:
\[ L = 7 \]

Now, substitute \( L = 7 \) back into \( W = L + 8 \):

",杰罗姆有 4 个朋友，他们在某一天来拜访他。在杰罗姆开门前，第一位朋友按了 20 次门铃，第二位朋友比杰罗姆的第一位朋友多按了 1/4 次门铃。第三位朋友比第四位朋友多按了 10 次门铃。如果第四位朋友按了 60 次门铃，门铃响了几次？,175,"Translation to English: Jerome has 4 friends who visited him on a certain day. Before Jerome opened the door, the first friend rang the doorbell 20 times, the second friend rang the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. The third friend rang the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. If the fourth friend rang the doorbell 60 times, how many times did the doorbell ring in total?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. The first friend rang the doorbell 20 times.
2. The second friend rang the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. So, the second friend rang the doorbell 20 + (1/4 * 20) = 20 + 5 = 25 times.
3. The fourth friend rang the doorbell 60 times.
4. The third friend rang the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend rang the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, we add up all the times the doorbell was rung:
20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 70 (third friend) + 60 (fourth friend) = 175 times.

1. First, calculate the internal dimensions of one box. Since the walls are 1 inch thick, we need to subtract 2 inches from each dimension (1 inch from each side):
   - Internal length = 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
   - Internal width = 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
   - Internal height = 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

2. Calculate the internal volume of one box:
   - Volume = length × width × height = 3 inches × 4 inches × 2 inches = 24 cubic inches

3. Since there are 3 boxes, calculate the total volume of the contents of all 3 boxes:
   - Total volume = 3 boxes × 24 cubic inches per box = 72 cubic inches

On Monday and Tuesday, he watches one episode of his favorite show each night, each episode is 1 hour long. On Wednesday, he watched several episodes of a show, each episode is 30 minutes long. On Thursday, he finished his homework early and watched one episode of a 1-hour show and one episode of a 30-minute show. On Friday, because it was the weekend, he could stay up late, so he watched 2 episodes of a 1-hour show. If he watched a total of 7 hours of TV, how many 30-minute episodes did he watch on Wednesday?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the total time spent watching TV on Monday and Tuesday:
   - Monday: 1 episode * 1 hour = 1 hour
   - Tuesday: 1 episode * 1 hour = 1 hour
   - Total for Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour + 1 hour = 2 hours

2. Calculate the total time spent watching TV on Thursday:
   - One 1-hour episode + one 30-minute episode = 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours

3. Calculate the total time spent watching TV on Friday:
   - 2 episodes * 1 hour = 2 hours

4. Add the total time spent watching TV on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:
   - 2 hours (Mon & Tue) + 1.5 hours (Thu) + 2 hours (Fri) = 5.5 hours

5. Subtract the total time spent on other days from the total time watched to find the time spent on Wednesday:
   - Total time watched = 7 hours
   - Time spent on other days = 5.5 hours
   - Time spent on Wednesday = 7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours

6. Calculate the number of 30-minute episodes watched on Wednesday:
   - 1.5 hours = 1.5 * 60 minutes = 90 minutes
   - Number of 30-minute episodes = 90 minutes / 30 minutes per episode = 3 episodes

",亨利正在为当地的一场烘焙竞赛制作饼干。他想比去年多做一倍。当他烤完后，他意识到自己实际上比想做的多做了 15 片饼干。在把饼干拿出去晾凉时，他掉了 5 片饼干，现在他一共有 110 片饼干。亨利去年做了多少片饼干？,50,"Translation to English: Question: Henry is making cookies for a local baking competition. He wants to make twice as many as last year. After baking, he realizes he actually made 15 more cookies than he wanted. While cooling the cookies, he dropped 5 cookies, and now he has a total of 110 cookies. How many cookies did Henry make last year?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry made last year.
2. Henry wanted to make twice as many cookies as last year, so he wanted to make \( 2x \) cookies.
3. He actually made 15 more cookies than he wanted, so he made \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4. He dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies he has now is \( 2x + 15 - 5 \).
5. We know he has 110 cookies now, so we set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 15 - 5 = 110
   \]
6. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   2x + 10 = 110
   \]
7. Subtract 10 from both sides:

Since she has some leftover wood, she decided to sell them. She has 10 pieces of 2 x 4 x 10 planks, each costing her $10. She also has 5 pieces of 4 x 4 x 10 planks, each costing her $16. If she sells all of them, how much profit can she make?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the original cost of the 2 x 4 x 10 planks:
   - She has 10 pieces, each costing $10.
   - Total cost for 2 x 4 x 10 planks = 10 pieces * $10 = $100.

2. Calculate the original cost of the 4 x 4 x 10 planks:
   - She has 5 pieces, each costing $16.
   - Total cost for 4 x 4 x 10 planks = 5 pieces * $16 = $80.

3. Calculate the total original cost for all the wood:
   - Total original cost = $100 (for 2 x 4 x 10 planks) + $80 (for 4 x 4 x 10 planks) = $180.

4. Calculate the selling price after a 50% increase:
   - The price increase is 50%, so the new price is 150% of the original price.
   - New price for each 2 x 4 x 10 plank = $10 * 1.5 = $15.
   - New price for each 4 x 4 x 10 plank = $16 * 1.5 = $24.

5. Calculate the total selling price:
   - Total selling price for 2 x 4 x 10 planks = 10 pieces * $15 = $150.
   - Total selling price for 4 x 4 x 10 planks = 5 pieces * $24 = $120.
   - Total selling price = $150 (for 2 x 4 x 10 planks) + $120 (for 4 x 4 x 10 planks) = $270.

6. Calculate the profit:
   - Profit = Total selling price - Total original cost.

Four years later, his salary increased, and his income is 40% higher than four years ago. If both Adrian's and Layla's salaries increase at the same time, and Adrian's income four years ago was $40,000, calculate the total salary of both people four years later.

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Adrian's salary four years ago was $40,000.
2. Adrian's salary is now 40% higher than it was four years ago. So, his current salary is:
   \[
   40,000 + (40,000 \times 0.40) = 40,000 + 16,000 = 56,000
   \]

3. Adrian's salary was 30% higher than Layla's salary four years ago. Let Layla's salary four years ago be \( L \). Therefore:
   \[
   40,000 = L + (L \times 0.30) = 1.30L
   \]
   Solving for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{40,000}{1.30} \approx 30,769.23
   \]

4. Layla's salary also increased by 40% over the four years. So, her current salary is:
   \[
   30,769.23 + (30,769.23 \times 0.40) = 30,769.23 + 12,307.69 \approx 43,076.92
   \]

5. The total salary of both Adrian and Layla four years later is:
   \[
   56,000 + 43,076.92 \approx 99,076.92

After adding these 20 letters, there are now 30 letters in the stack of letters that already have stamps. This means that before she added the 20 letters, there were \( 30 - 20 = 10 \) letters in that stack.

She noticed that the plastic spoons were all used up, so she bought a new pack of spoons. Later, her husband also bought a pack of 5 new spoons and gave them to Juliet. When Juliet was making the stew, she used 3 spoons to taste the stew. Later, when she was setting the table, there were a total of 12 spoons. How many spoons were in the pack that Juliet bought?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Let \( x \) be the number of spoons in the pack that Juliet bought.
2. Juliet's husband bought a pack of 5 spoons.
3. Juliet used 3 spoons while making the stew.
4. When setting the table, there were 12 spoons in total.

If Tim can ride his skateboard at a speed of 264 feet per minute, how long will the winner be waiting at home before the loser finishes the race?

How much money did she make that day in dollars?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Each two-wheeled bicycle has 2 tires. 5 people came with two-wheeled bicycles, so the total number of tires is 5 * 2 = 10 tires.
2. Each tricycle has 3 tires. 3 people came with tricycles, so the total number of tires is 3 * 3 = 9 tires.
3. Each unicycle has 1 tire. 1 person came with a unicycle, so the total number of tires is 1 * 1 = 1 tire.
4. Adding all the tires together: 10 (two-wheeled bicycles) + 9 (tricycles) + 1 (unicycle) = 20 tires.
5. The cost to inflate each tire is 25 cents. Therefore, the total earnings in cents are 20 * 25 = 500 cents.

He ate 14 fries before a hungry seagull stole the bag from his hand. After the seagull landed, it gobbled up half the number of fries Dave had eaten. Then, 3 pigeons chased it away, and each pigeon ate 3 fries. Later, a raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. Ants carried away the last fry, leaving 5 fries. How many fries were in the bag when Dave bought it?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Dave ate 14 fries.
2. The seagull ate half the number of fries Dave ate: \( \frac{14}{2} = 7 \) fries.
3. The pigeons ate \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) fries.
4. Let \( x \) be the total number of fries in the bag initially.
5. After Dave ate 14 fries, the remaining fries were \( x - 14 \).
6. After the seagull ate 7 fries, the remaining fries were \( x - 14 - 7 = x - 21 \).
7. After the pigeons ate 9 fries, the remaining fries were \( x - 21 - 9 = x - 30 \).
8. The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, leaving one-third. Let \( y \) be the remaining fries after the raccoon stole them. Then:
   \[
   y = \frac{1}{3}(x - 30)
   \]
9. The ants carried away the last fry, leaving 5 fries. Therefore:
   \[
   y - 1 = 5 \implies y = 6
   \]
10. Substitute \( y = 6 \) into the equation \( y = \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) \):
    \[
    6 = \frac{1}{3}(x - 30)
    \]
11. Solve for \( x \):

Each bread roll is 4 inches long, each croissant is 6 inches long, and each baguette is 2 feet long. If Bill connects all the baked goods end to end, how long will they be in total in feet?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Convert the length of bread rolls and croissants from inches to feet:
   - Each bread roll is 4 inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 4 inches is \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet.
   - Each croissant is 6 inches long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, 6 inches is \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet.

2. Calculate the total length of all bread rolls in feet:
   - 300 bread rolls, each \( \frac{1}{3} \) feet long: \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.

3. Calculate the total length of all croissants in feet:
   - 120 croissants, each \( \frac{1}{2} \) feet long: \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.

4. Calculate the total length of all baguettes in feet:
   - 60 baguettes, each 2 feet long: \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) feet.

",布莱克和凯利在进行一场比赛，看看谁能在 15 分钟内跑最远。他们决定在一个长 100 码的足球场上进行比赛。布莱克来回跑了 15 次。凯利来回跑了一次，然后决定自己不想在布莱克旁边跑，所以她开始跑到 40 码线并返回。她这样跑了 34 次。获胜者比失败者多跑多远？,80,"Translation to English: Blake and Kelly are having a race to see who can run the farthest in 15 minutes. They decide to race on a 100-yard long football field. Blake ran back and forth 15 times. Kelly ran back and forth once, then decided she didn't want to run next to Blake, so she started running to the 40-yard line and back. She did this 34 times. How much farther did the winner run compared to the loser?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the total distance Blake ran:
   - Blake ran back and forth 15 times on a 100-yard field.
   - Each back and forth is 2 * 100 = 200 yards.
   - Total distance Blake ran = 15 * 200 = 3000 yards.

2. Calculate the total distance Kelly ran:
   - Kelly ran back and forth once on a 100-yard field.
   - Distance for this is 2 * 100 = 200 yards.
   - Then Kelly ran to the 40-yard line and back 34 times.
   - Each trip to the 40-yard line and back is 2 * 40 = 80 yards.
   - Total distance for these trips = 34 * 80 = 2720 yards.
   - Total distance Kelly ran = 200 + 2720 = 2920 yards.

3. Determine the difference in distance between Blake and Kelly:
   - Blake ran 3000 yards.
   - Kelly ran 2920 yards.
   - Difference = 3000 - 2920 = 80 yards.

Step-by-Step Answer: 
1. Let Brooke's current age be \( B \).
2. Since Seth's age is twice Brooke's age, Seth's current age is \( 2B \).
3. In two years, Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \) and Seth's age will be \( 2B + 2 \).
4. The sum of their ages in two years will be \( (B + 2) + (2B + 2) = 28 \).
5. Simplify the equation: \( B + 2 + 2B + 2 = 28 \).
6. Combine like terms: \( 3B + 4 = 28 \).
7. Subtract 4 from both sides: \( 3B = 24 \).
8. Divide by 3: \( B = 8 \).

So, Brooke is currently 8 years old. Since Seth's age is twice Brooke's age:
9. Seth's age is \( 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16 \).

It takes Billy about one and a half minutes to peel one potato, but only about 5 seconds to chop one potato. How long will it take Billy to prepare these potatoes?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. First, calculate the time it takes to peel one potato:
   - 1 minute and 30 seconds is equivalent to 1.5 minutes.

2. Calculate the time it takes to chop one potato:
   - 5 seconds is equivalent to 5/60 minutes, which simplifies to 1/12 minutes.

3. Calculate the total time to prepare one potato (peeling + chopping):
   - Time to peel one potato = 1.5 minutes
   - Time to chop one potato = 1/12 minutes
   - Total time for one potato = 1.5 + 1/12 = 1.5 + 0.0833 ≈ 1.5833 minutes

For each gallon of lemonade they make, they need to spend $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar. They can make 20 cups per gallon, and each cup sells for $0.50. If their profit is $25, how much did they spend on lemons?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the revenue from selling one gallon of lemonade:
   - Each gallon makes 20 cups.
   - Each cup sells for $0.50.
   - Revenue per gallon = 20 cups * $0.50/cup = $10.

2. Calculate the cost of making one gallon of lemonade:
   - Cost of lemons per gallon = $3.
   - Cost of sugar per gallon = $2.
   - Total cost per gallon = $3 + $2 = $5.

3. Calculate the profit per gallon:
   - Profit per gallon = Revenue per gallon - Cost per gallon.
   - Profit per gallon = $10 - $5 = $5.

4. Determine how many gallons were sold to achieve a profit of $25:
   - Total profit = $25.
   - Profit per gallon = $5.
   - Number of gallons sold = $25 / $5 = 5 gallons.

5. Calculate the total cost of lemons for the gallons sold:
   - Cost of lemons per gallon = $3.
   - Number of gallons = 5.
   - Total cost of lemons = 5 gallons * $3/gallon = $15.

If Zaid earns $6,000 per month, how much money does he have left after paying all these expenses and donations?

Step-by-Step Answer:

Sandra threatened that if the missing red roses are not delivered by 5 PM, she will change suppliers. How many red roses must Fred deliver by 5 PM to keep Sandra's business?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Let the number of white carnations be \( x \).
2. The number of pink calla lilies is 200, which is 5 times the number of white carnations. Therefore, \( 5x = 200 \).
3. Solving for \( x \), we get \( x = \frac{200}{5} = 40 \). So, there are 40 white carnations.
4. The number of red roses is 4 times the number of white carnations. Therefore, the number of red roses is \( 4 \times 40 = 160 \).

In this race, each team has 4 members, and each member runs 400 meters or one lap around the standard track. Among these two teams, one team is very consistent, with each member running their 400-meter segment in exactly 55 seconds. The other team is less consistent, with the first runner taking 60 seconds to complete the 400-meter segment, and each subsequent runner being 3 seconds faster than the previous one. Based on this information, by how many seconds does the faster team win?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the total time for the consistent team:
   - Each of the 4 members runs 400 meters in 55 seconds.
   - Total time = 4 * 55 = 220 seconds.

2. Calculate the total time for the inconsistent team:
   - First runner: 60 seconds.
   - Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
   - Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
   - Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.
   - Total time = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die.
   - The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - Probability = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

2. Calculate the probability of rolling an even number on a six-sided die.
   - The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.
   - There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.
   - Probability of rolling an even number = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5 or 50%.

3. Calculate the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on the first roll is 1/2.
   - The probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is also 1/2.
   - The combined probability = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25 or 25%.

Mice are kept in 3 cages with the same number of mice in each cage, and each mouse gets 6 straws. Hamsters are kept in 10 cages individually, and each hamster gets 5 straws. Additionally, there is one cage of rabbits that gets 20 straws. No other places in the pet store use straw. If 160 straws are distributed to the small rodents, how many mice are in each cage?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the total number of straws given to the hamsters:
   - There are 10 cages of hamsters, and each hamster gets 5 straws.
   - Total straws for hamsters = 10 * 5 = 50 straws.

2. Calculate the number of straws given to the rabbits:
   - The rabbits get 20 straws.

3. Calculate the total number of straws given to the mice:
   - Total straws distributed = 160 straws.
   - Straws for hamsters and rabbits = 50 (hamsters) + 20 (rabbits) = 70 straws.
   - Straws for mice = 160 - 70 = 90 straws.

4. Determine the number of mice in each cage:
   - There are 3 cages of mice, and each mouse gets 6 straws.
   - Let the number of mice in each cage be \( x \).

In the third month, she collected twice the total number of cards she collected in the first and second months. How many Pokémon cards does she have in total now?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokémon cards.
2. In the first month, she collected three times the initial amount: \( 3 \times 20 = 60 \) cards.
3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than in the first month: \( 60 - 20 = 40 \) cards.
4. In the third month, she collected twice the total number of cards she collected in the first and second months: \( 2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200 \) cards.
5. To find the total number of cards she has now, we add the initial amount and the cards collected over the three months: \( 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 \) cards.

He edits the same number of sentences each week for two different publishers, and they each pay him a different rate per sentence. Publisher B pays Mark twice the rate that Publisher A pays. Mark edits a total of 1,000 sentences each week, and Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence. How many cents does Mark earn each week?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Let the number of sentences Mark edits for each publisher be \( x \). Since he edits the same number of sentences for both publishers and the total is 1,000, we have:
   \[
   x + x = 1000 \implies 2x = 1000 \implies x = 500
   \]
   So, Mark edits 500 sentences for each publisher.

2. Publisher A pays 5 cents per sentence. Therefore, the total earnings from Publisher A are:
   \[
   500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. Publisher B pays twice the rate of Publisher A, which is:
   \[
   2 \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 10 \text{ cents/sentence}

   Therefore, the total earnings from Publisher B are:
   \[
   500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents}

4. The total earnings from both publishers are:

If he earns $2,000 per week (every week of the year), and he won the award on the first day of the year, how much does he earn in total for the year?.

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate John's original annual salary:

3. Calculate the new annual salary after the raise:
   - New annual salary = $104,000 + $5,200 = $109,200.

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Carl eats sandwiches for lunch every day this week. There are 7 days in a week, and each sandwich uses 2 slices of cheese.

Mr. Bert conducts 6 exams each semester. He allows students to drop the lowest score from their average for the semester. If Brinley scored 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86 in the first five exams, what score does she need to achieve on the sixth exam to have an average score of 93?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. To find the required score for the sixth exam, we first need to determine the total score needed to achieve an average of 93 after dropping the lowest score.
2. Since the average is calculated after dropping the lowest score, we need the sum of the highest 5 scores to be \( 93 \times 5 = 465 \).

3. First, we calculate the sum of Brinley's first five scores:
   \[
   89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438
   \]

4. To find the lowest score among the first five, we identify that 71 is the lowest score.

5. We then calculate the sum of the highest 4 scores from the first five exams:
   \[
   89 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 367
   \]

6. To achieve the required total of 465, we need the sum of these 4 scores plus the sixth score to equal 465:
   \[
   367 + \text{sixth score} = 465
   \]

7. Solving for the sixth score:

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. First, calculate the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Each plate costs $6,000.
   - Half a dozen plates means 6 / 2 = 3 plates.
   - Total cost of 3 plates = 3 * $6,000 = $18,000.

2. The total cost of twenty dozen cups is $1,200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates.
   - Therefore, the total cost of twenty dozen cups = $18,000 - $1,200 = $16,800.

3. Calculate the number of cups in twenty dozen.
   - One dozen equals 12 cups.
   - Twenty dozen equals 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

The red chickens lay 3 eggs each day, and the white chickens lay 5 eggs each day. Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. If he has two more white chickens than red chickens, how many red chickens does he have?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Let the number of red chickens be \( r \).
2. Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, the number of white chickens is \( r + 2 \).
3. Each red chicken lays 3 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs from red chickens is \( 3r \).
4. Each white chicken lays 5 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs from white chickens is \( 5(r + 2) \).
5. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs per day, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   3r + 5(r + 2) = 42

6. Simplify and solve the equation:

If he walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour, how many hours does his walk take?

",杰瑞有两座水池，均有缺口，都以 4 加仑/分钟的速度将其排空。4 分钟前，大水池的水量是小水池的两倍。现在大水池的水量是小水池的四倍。小水池里现在有多少水？,8,"Translation to English: Jerry has two pools, both with leaks, each draining at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Four minutes ago, the amount of water in the large pool was twice that of the small pool. Now, the amount of water in the large pool is four times that of the small pool. How much water is in the small pool now?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Let \( S \) be the amount of water in the small pool now.
2. Let \( L \) be the amount of water in the large pool now.
3. According to the problem, \( L = 4S \).

4. Four minutes ago, both pools were draining at 4 gallons per minute. Therefore, the small pool had \( S + 4 \times 4 = S + 16 \) gallons, and the large pool had \( L + 4 \times 4 = L + 16 \) gallons.

5. Four minutes ago, the large pool had twice the amount of water as the small pool:
   \[
   L + 16 = 2(S + 16)
   \]

6. Substitute \( L = 4S \) into the equation:
   \[
   4S + 16 = 2(S + 16)
   \]

7. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   4S + 16 = 2S + 32
   \]

8. Subtract \( 2S \) from both sides:
   \[
   2S + 16 = 32
   \]

9. Subtract 16 from both sides:
   \[
   2S = 16
   \]

10. Divide by 2:
    \[
    S = 8
    \]

If she plans to pay $165 per month for 12 months, how much will Janice still owe at the end of that period?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the total amount Janice needs to repay, including the additional 10%.
   - 10% of $2,000 is $2,000 * 0.10 = $200.
   - Total amount to repay = $2,000 + $200 = $2,200.

2. Calculate the total amount Janice will have paid after 12 months.
   - Monthly payment = $165.
   - Total payment over 12 months = 12 * $165 = $1,980.

3. Determine the remaining amount Janice will owe after 12 months.
   - Total amount to repay = $2,200.
   - Amount paid after 12 months = $1,980.
   - Remaining amount = $2,200 - $1,980 = $220.

If he lost 8 water-type cards and bought 14 grass-type cards, what is the probability that a randomly chosen card is a water-type card (rounded to the nearest integer)?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the initial total number of cards:
   30 (fire) + 20 (grass) + 40 (water) = 90 cards.

2. Adjust for the changes:
   - He lost 8 water-type cards: 40 - 8 = 32 water-type cards.
   - He bought 14 grass-type cards: 20 + 14 = 34 grass-type cards.

3. Calculate the new total number of cards:
   30 (fire) + 34 (grass) + 32 (water) = 96 cards.

4. Determine the probability of picking a water-type card:
   The number of water-type cards is 32.
   The total number of cards is 96.
   Probability = (number of water-type cards / total number of cards) * 100
               = (32 / 96) * 100
               = 33.33% (approximately).

When she returned two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons had ripened, so she picked them all. How many watermelons were still unripe after these two weeks?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. The farm produced 120 small watermelons.
2. 30% of the watermelons were ready to be picked when Ashlyn first visited.

3. The remaining watermelons after the first visit were \( 120 - 36 = 84 \) watermelons.
4. Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining 84 watermelons had ripened.
   - 3/4 of 84 is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \) watermelons.

The auditorium has 3 entrances A, B, and C, which also serve as exits. After a meeting, 30% of the students exited through exit A, 3/5 of the remaining students exited through exit B, and the rest exited through exit C. Calculate the number of students who exited through exit C.

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the number of students who exited through exit A:
   30% of 1,000 students = 0.30 * 1,000 = 300 students.

2. Calculate the number of students remaining after exit A:
   1,000 - 300 = 700 students.

3. Calculate the number of students who exited through exit B:
   3/5 of the remaining 700 students = (3/5) * 700 = 420 students.

4. Calculate the number of students remaining after exit B:
   700 - 420 = 280 students.

Therefore, the number of students who exited through exit C is 280.

Each of them sends 2 letters of 5 pages each per week. He responds in the same way. He can write one page in 6 minutes. How many hours does he spend writing letters each week?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Mike now has 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals.
2. Each pen pal sends 2 letters per week, and each letter is 5 pages long. So, each pen pal sends 2 * 5 = 10 pages per week.
3. Since Mike has 3 pen pals, the total number of pages he needs to respond to is 3 * 10 = 30 pages per week.
4. Mike writes at the same rate, so he also writes 30 pages per week.
5. Mike can write one page in 6 minutes. Therefore, to write 30 pages, he needs 30 * 6 = 180 minutes.

On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on the second day. If one cookie contains 200 calories, how many more calories did Sue consume compared to her sister?

Step-by-Step Answer:
1. Calculate the number of cookies Sue ate on Monday:
   Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday.
   Sue ate 4 times as many, so Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies on Monday.

2. Calculate the number of cookies Sue ate on Tuesday:
   Sue's sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday.
   Sue ate twice as many, so Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies on Tuesday.

3. Calculate the total number of cookies Sue ate:
   Sue ate 20 cookies on Monday and 26 cookies on Tuesday.
   Total cookies Sue ate = 20 + 26 = 46 cookies.

4. Calculate the total number of cookies Sue's sister ate:
   Sue's sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 cookies on Tuesday.
   Total cookies Sue's sister ate = 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

5. Calculate the difference in the number of cookies eaten:
   Difference in cookies = 46 - 18 = 28 cookies.

6. Calculate the difference in calories consumed:
   Each cookie contains 200 calories.
   Difference in calories = 28 cookies * 200 calories/cookie = 5600 calories.
